#   rev 2.0  Mar 15 2026 mab - echo -e to printf, allow install from local repository
#   - prior history suppressed 
#
#   rev 2.1 Apr 27 2026 dsm - change git repository to codeberg.org
#
#   rev 2.1ai May 24 2026 dsm - modified script to test ai version
#
#   09 Sep 2026 - two questions removed and the source fixed.  The installer no
#   longer asks whether to keep the download, and no longer asks which
#   repository to use: it always clones the main branch from
#   github.com/dmontaine/SDCore4Linux and always deletes the download when it
#   finishes.  The <D>evelopment branch and <L>ocal repository options are gone
#   with the question.  Debian and Ubuntu only for now - the pacman, dnf and
#   zypper branches are removed and a non-Debian system is refused by name
#   rather than silently taking a branch that installs nothing; Arch, Fedora and
#   openSUSE are served by the upstream sdb64 installer until this one is
#   stable.
#
#   10 Sep 2026 - two changes on the owner's ruling of that day.  The
#   installing user is registered as an SD ADMINISTRATOR (the ADMINISTRATOR
#   keyword on create-account) instead of a STANDARD account, so a fresh
#   install has a registered administrator and CPROC's bootstrap arm is a
#   fallback rather than the way in.  And a caller who cannot sudo is refused
#   at the first sudo, in words, instead of failing part-way with sudo's own
#   error.  Both are PRE_RELEASE 24.
#
#   13 Sep 2026 - the sdsys data directories are lower case on disk (plan M3
#   D1): accounts, newvoc, voc_template, messages, syscom, sd.voclib, and the
#   bootstrap's $ipc, $map, $map.dic, voc.dic, accounts.dic, dict.dic, dir_dict.
#   A saved register is looked for as /home/sd/accounts only.
#
#   13 Sep 2026 - and the program directories (plan M3 D2): gpl.bp,
#   gpl.bp.out, bp, bp.out and pcode.out.  sd.service is Type=oneshot
#   (PRE_RELEASE 29).
#
#   13 Sep 2026 - account names are lower case, the system account included:
#   its register record is accounts/sdsys.
#
#   14 Sep 2026 - the closing "two reboots / kickstart" note is gone: the
#   Type=oneshot unit held on every boot start since 13 Sep (PRE_RELEASE 29).
#
#   14 Sep 2026 - process dumps go to $sdsysdir/dumps (1730 sdsys:sdusers),
#   and DUMPDIR is added to a restored sd.conf that lacks it (PORT_ADOPTION 25).
#
#   14 Sep 2026 - the build runs as the calling user; only the install steps
#   use sudo (PRE_RELEASE 16).
#
#   15 Sep 2026 - the install ends by setting the SD password of the account it
#   makes for the installing user, with MODIFY.PASSWORD at the terminal - the
#   Windows port's finishing step.  For that account only: an SDSYS password,
#   which the port also sets, would unlock nothing on Linux.  W.4 phase 6, the
#   owner's ruling of that day.  REVERSED 18 Sep 2026 (owner): no SD password
#   is asked at install - a Linux login already reaches the SD account.
#
#   19 Sep 2026 - BACK, AND REQUIRED (owner, via the Windows port): the one
#   account an install makes without a credential is the installer's own, and
#   it has remote routes.  Asked up to three times, verified in $cred, never
#   passed as an argument; a kept credential is left alone.

# 09 Sep 26  Now GitHub, always the main branch, and no longer a choice.  The
#            repository moved to github.com/dmontaine/SDCore4Linux; codeberg is
#            where this came from and is not where it is maintained.

# 09 Sep 26  THE DOWNLOAD GOES UNDER $HOME, NOT INTO WHATEVER DIRECTORY THE
#            SCRIPT WAS RUN FROM.  It used to be "$(pwd)/.sdb64tmp", so running
#            the installer from a clone of this repository dropped a 4 MB build
#            tree inside the project and made "git status" dirty - and a clean
#            git status is a working instrument here.  Absolute, so it does not

#            The old codeberg repository WAS the source tree - its root held

#            holds the installer at the root and the source under sdb_ai/, so
#            the clone gives <tmp>/sdb_ai/sd64.  Building from <tmp> would fail

#
# ***THE ONE FLAG THAT DEFEATED THE RULING ALREADY IN PLACE.***  The 18 Sep

# common greeter use to decide an account is plumbing and hide it.  So the
# ruling was implemented and invisible: the owner, at his own machine, found
# "there is no linux sdsys account listed to switch to" while following SD's
# own refusal message.
#
# NOT --system, therefore.  Everything else about the account is unchanged: it
# is NOT in sudo or wheel, it reaches root only through the sd-elevate drop-in
# below, and sd-elevate refuses it as a TARGET by name (require_sd_user), not
# by uid - so raising the uid above UID_MIN opens no door that the uid test was

# WHY.  SD's account verbs shell out to sudo (useradd, passwd, usermod,
# groupadd, groupdel, userdel, chmod g+s) from ten call sites in GPL.BP.  With
# no sudoers configuration those block on a PASSWORD PROMPT INSIDE an SD
# session, which is a hang rather than an error - measured 9 Sep 2026, when
# "sudo -n -v" on this machine answered "a password is required".
#
# The drop-in names ONE command, SD's own helper, which validates its

# directly would be root by another route.

# Root-owned, and deliberately NOT under /usr/local/sdsys: that tree is

#            ADMINISTRATOR - the tier model.  With the tiers gone the account
#            is a plain one: the installing user administers by LOGGING IN as
#            sdsys (its own password, at the keyboard or a desktop-sharing
#            view of it), and needs no register rank to be who they are.
#
#            AN EXISTING ACCOUNT IS NOT TOUCHED.  The directory test above
#            means an upgrade that saved its accounts keeps what it has,
#            so this seeds a fresh install rather than changing anybody.
# 11 Sep 26  ADOPT, AND THE MARKER THAT MAKES IT INSTALL-ONLY (PORT_ADOPTION 15).
#            CREATE.ACCOUNT now REFUSES a pre-existing Linux user (10038) - the
#            owner's rule is that SD accounts create their own Linux user, and
#            the installer's own user is the single exception.  ADOPT is that
#            exception and it needs BOTH -internal and this one-shot marker,
#            which CREATEA deletes as it accepts the keyword.
#
#            ***THE MARKER IS WRITTEN HERE AND NEVER SHIPPED.***  One in the
#            source tree would be copied into every install and leave the door
#            open permanently, which is the state this replaces.  It is removed
#            again below whatever happens, so a failed create cannot leave it.
#
#            THIS RUNS ON THE IS_INSTALL CPROC, whose entry block grants the
#            administrator bootstrap and does not refuse root (18 Sep, S.26).
# 11 Sep 26  PORT_ADOPTION 16 (port PRE_RELEASE_FIXES 70).  Captured BEFORE the
#            seeding block, because that block creates the very directory this

#            UPGRADE rather than a first one, and the walk below is for upgrades:
#            on a first install every account is built from the current NEWVOC
#            already, so there is nothing to bring forward.
# 19 Sep 26  ADOPT IS NOW ATTACH, and the line matches SD Core for Windows'
#            (agreed by mail, 19 Sep 00:10): marker $attach.<name>, no
#            NO.QUERY - the ATTACH arm never prompts.  AND THE ACCOUNT NAME IS
#            FOLDED (the port's RELEASE_1.1 67): CREATEA now names the account,
#            its directory and its sdu_ group in lower case even when the Linux
#            user is not, so every test here uses the folded name.  The fold is

# 15 Sep 26  W.4 PHASE 6: THE INSTALL SETS THE INSTALLING USER'S SD PASSWORD -
#            THE WINDOWS PORT'S FINISHING STEP (finish-install.ps1:375).  An API
#            login is SCRAM against the account's credential in $cred, which only
#            MODIFY.PASSWORD writes, so an install ended with no account able to
#            use the API at all and nothing on screen said so.
#
#            THAT ONE ACCOUNT, NOT SDSYS - the owner's ruling of 15 Sep 2026, and
#            the one departure from the port.  Windows sets SDSYS's as well
#            because an ELEVATED Windows session lands in SDSYS and LOGIN's
#            require.credential asks there (port PRE_RELEASE_FIXES 138,
#            finish-install.ps1:379-407).  NEITHER HALF OF THAT HOLDS HERE: this
#            LOGIN has no require.credential anywhere, and sdsys could not use
#            the API even with a password - after the teardown the API refuses
#            SDSYS unless the connection is from this machine (10174), and SDSYS
#            is entered locally anyway.  An SDSYS password here would unlock
#            nothing.
#
#            THE THREE FAULTS THAT KILLED THE PORT'S FIRST PASSWORD STEP
#            (adopt-account.ps1:46-61).  A change that brings back any one of
#            them fails the same silent way:
#            * A SESSION NEEDS A RUNNING SERVER - sysseg.c:133, "SD has not been
#              started."  SD is stopped a few lines above, so this starts it and
#              stops it again, leaving the machine as this step found it.
#            * IT NEEDS AN ADMINISTRATOR (18 Sep 26, S.26).  $cred is
#              sdsys:sdusers 0700 and MODIFY.PASSWORD refuses before prompting
#              unless the administrator flag is set - so this runs as the
#              sdsys OS user, the one administrator, on a local session:
#              CPROC grants it, exactly as an operator would after install.
#            * THE OUTPUT HAS TO SURVIVE.  It runs in this terminal with the rest
#              of the install, not in a window that closes on the error.
#
#            SKIPPED WHEN A KEEP CYCLE ALREADY HAS A CREDENTIAL ($cred is restored
#            at :786), as the port skips a reinstall.  ***THE PORT'S REASON FOR
#            SKIPPING DOES NOT ARISE HERE***: it would be asked for the OLD
#            password, whereas this is an administrator setting another account -
#            the session is sdsys - and SET_ACC_PASSWORD asks for the current one
#            only for your own.  The reason here is simply that the person
#            already set one and a reinstall must not quietly replace it.
#
#            NON-FATAL EVERY WAY IT CAN GO: declining, a failure, or no terminal
#            leaves the install complete and says how to set one later.  ***AND
#            NO INSTRUMENT CAN WITNESS IT***: "input ... hidden" needs a tty and
#            every automated route in this project pipes stdin (the port's
#            structural note, finish-install.ps1:121-127).  The first install at
#            a keyboard is the witness; the $cred test below is what makes a
#            prompt that never appeared visible instead of silent.
# 18 Sep 26 dm - S.26, THE OWNER'S NIGHT RULING: administration is by LOGGING
# IN as sdsys, so the account needs a password of its own - set here, at a
# hidden prompt, by whoever is installing.  There is no other way in: SD
# refuses a session that arrived by sudo or su from another user (CPROC
# 10195), and sshd denies sdsys the network.  A desktop-sharing view of the
# console (VNC, TeamViewer) is a local login and works.
# 20 Sep 26 dm - SAY WHAT IS COMING, AND WHOSE IT IS (owner, 20 Sep 2026, after
#   an install: "It is not clear what users are being asked for and confusing
#   that it goes sdsys, os, sdsys.  There should be a message stating that the
#   user will be entering 3 passwords ... the prompts should make it very clear
#   which password is being entered").  The order he asked for is the order
#   these already ran in - his own Linux password at the start (sudo), then
#   sdsys's Linux one, then sdsys's SD one; what he did not recognise was the
#   THIRD prompt, his own account's SD password, which he required on 19 Sep.
#   So: a list before the first of them, and every heading and prompt below
#   names the account AND which of its two passwords it is.

# 20 Sep 26 dm - THE INSTALLING USER'S OWN PASSWORD COMES FIRST (owner, 20 Sep
#   2026: the three ran "sdsys, installer, sdsys", and he asked for the
#   installer's own first, then sdsys's two).  This block was below the sdsys
#   Linux one; moving it up is safe because it needs no password of sdsys's -
#   it reaches MODIFY.PASSWORD through the root loginuid bridge, not a login.
# 18 Sep 26 dm - (REVERSED 19 Sep, below.)  The step was removed on the
#            owner's ruling that a Linux login already reaches the account.
# 19 Sep 26 dm - THE INSTALL-TIME SD PASSWORD IS BACK, AND REQUIRED (owner, on
#            the Windows side, 19 Sep 2026; the port's RELEASE_1.1 70, relayed
#            by mail 01:40 and binding here).  His words: ask for it during
#            install, "saying that it only has to be used for remote access",
#            and on whether it may be skipped: "required".  The 18 Sep reason
#            was true only AT THE KEYBOARD: every account but sdsys has remote
#            routes, and the installing user's account is the ONE account per
#            machine made without a credential - an ordinary CREATE.ACCOUNT
#            writes one through set_passwd, ATTACH deliberately does not.
#
#            ON LINUX "REMOTE" MEANS THE API.  ssh signs in with the Linux
#            password; the SD password is the API's SCRAM credential ($cred),
#            and the wording below says so rather than repeat the port's.
#
#            THE PASSWORD IS NEVER AN ARGUMENT: MODIFY.PASSWORD asks for it
#            itself, hidden, twice, so nothing here holds the plaintext and it
#            cannot reach a command line, a log or the command stack.
#
#            "REQUIRED" IS SAID HONESTLY - ASKED AGAIN, NOT ENFORCED.  Nothing
#            can stop somebody leaving the prompt.  So: ask, VERIFY that
#            $cred/<name> appeared (the prompt that never showed must not read
#            as success - the port's regression of 24 Aug 2026), ask again, up
#            to three times, then print the one command that puts it right.
#
#            A KEEP CYCLE'S CREDENTIAL IS LEFT ALONE: a reinstall over kept
#            accounts must not replace a password somebody has been using.
#
#            THE ROUTE: MODIFY.PASSWORD for ANOTHER account needs the
#            administrator, and only a sdsys login administers (S.26) - so the
#            install, as root, gives this one process tree sdsys's loginuid
#            (the witnesses' bridge, granted by M8d on the 19 Sep cycle).  It
#            grants nothing to anyone not already root; if the write fails the
#            session is refused (10195) and the $cred check says "not set".

# 19 Sep 26 dm - AND SDSYS'S SD PASSWORD, WHICH THIS INSTALLER USED TO WITHHOLD.
#            REVERSES THE 15 Sep RULING ABOVE, on the owner's decision of 19 Sep
#            2026: "I have no problem with the user having to enter two
#            passwords, one for the os level sdsys and a second for sd itself.
#            The ability to use the API outweighs the slight inconvenience."
#
#            WHY IT WAS WITHHELD, AND WHY THAT REASONING WAS WRONG.  The note
#            above says sdsys "could not use the API even with a password,
#            because the API refuses SDSYS unless the connection is from this
#            machine".  10174 refuses sdsys only when the peer is REMOTE - a
#            LOCAL connection was always admitted, so the capability was real
#            and the missing password was the only thing shutting it.  That is
#            a door held closed by an omission, which is the kind that opens
#            when somebody later supplies what was missing.
#
#            WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO ISSUE NOW: APISRVR no longer trusts the
#            ADDRESS for this one account.  SDSYS over the API is Unix-socket
#            only and the kernel must say the socket was opened by the sdsys OS
#            user itself (system(43), SO_PEERCRED - an ssh -L tunnel reports its
#            own owner, and sdsys can never own one because sshd denies it).
#            So the password unlocks a local sdsys process and nothing else.
#
#            TWO PASSWORDS, AND THE TEXT SAYS SO: this is not the Linux password
#            asked for earlier - that one signs sdsys in at the machine.
