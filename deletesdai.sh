#   rev 2.0  Mar 15 2026 mab - echo -e to printf
#   - prior history suppressed
#
#   15 Sep 2026 - the API's TLS server identity (/etc/sd-tls) is kept when the
#   accounts are kept, and removed only on a full DELETE.  A reinstall that
#   keeps your database now keeps the server's identity with it.
#
#   13 Sep 2026 - the account register is sdsys/accounts on disk (plan M3 D1),
#   so a kept register is saved as /home/sd/accounts, the name installsdai.sh
#   restores.  An install from before the rename has sdsys/ACCOUNTS, which this
#   does not look for: no install needs carrying across (owner, 12-13 Sep) -
#   take the delete-accounts path instead.

# install's first API connection.
#
# 15 Sep 26 dm - ***IT GOES WITH THE ACCOUNTS NOW, LIKE $cred ABOVE*** (owner's
# ruling that day: the identity persists for 1.1; client-side recognition is
# 1.2's mutual enrolment).  A keep cycle used to destroy the server's identity,
# so the next install came up with a NEW key while the accounts, passwords and
# audit trail were all the ones the machine had before.  Nothing notices today,
# because no client checks the key - but the moment one does, every upgrade
# would look exactly like an impostor, and a warning that fires on every routine
# upgrade is one people learn to click through.  So the decision is taken before
# the clients exist, not after.
#
# It is LEFT IN PLACE rather than saved and restored: unlike $cred it lives
# outside the sdsys tree, at /etc/sd-tls, and installsdai.sh never touches it -
# the relay picks it up on the next first API connection.  DELETE removes it,
# which is the case where the machine is genuinely being wiped.

# PRE_RELEASE 14 - the privileged helper and its sudoers drop-in.

# ORDER MATTERS: the drop-in goes FIRST.  It names the sdsys user, and a

# is a dangling entry in the file that decides who may become root.  Removing
# the rule before anything it mentions means there is never a moment where
# one outlives the other.

#            is deleted, because --remove IS the helper; it validates the result
#            with sshd -t and reloads sshd, and leaves sshd_config untouched if
#            no SD block is present.  Non-fatal: a stale block matching a group

# 10 Sep 26  PRE_RELEASE 25 - THE GROUP GOES ONLY IF THE ACCOUNTS GO.
#            This removal was unconditional, and it was a lock-out on a

#            sdapi are not created any more (the administrator is the sdsys OS
#            user; the API is open to every account except SDSYS), so these
#            lines now only tidy machines installed before the teardown, and
#            only when the accounts go too.  A keep-accounts cycle leaves the
#            legacy groups exactly as it found them.
# 20 Sep 26 dm - S.29 BRINGS sdssh AND sdapi BACK, so sdapi is no longer a
#   leftover to tidy: it and sdssh are where each account's remote routes are
#   recorded.  They go with the accounts and never without them - on a keep
#   cycle the memberships ARE the routes the accounts still have.  sdadmin
#   stays legacy: the teardown removed the administrator group for good.
