"""test-apiroute-units.py - the sdapi gate in APISRVR, as invariants.

  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-apiroute-units.py
  python3 .../test-apiroute-units.py --selftest

No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 it
could not run.  Written 20 Sep 26 for S.29 part 3.

***WHAT THIS IS AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT IS NOT.***  It reads
sdsys/gpl.bp/apisrvr as text.  ***IT DOES NOT RUN BASIC, SO IT CANNOT SAY THE
GATE REFUSES ANYBODY*** - only that the gate is still written, still in the
right place, and still shaped the way S.29 needs.  The refusal itself is
measured on an install, by witness-release-run.sh section 13f, which drives a
real SCRAM login for an account whose route has been taken away.  A green run
here is not evidence that the API is gated; it is evidence that nothing has
quietly deleted or reordered the gate since the cycle that measured it.

WHY A TEXT CHECK IS WORTH HAVING ANYWAY.  There is no way to compile or run
GPL.BP without an install (the two-stage bootstrap, CLAUDE.md "Testing"), so
between cycles the only guard on this code is a reader.  Three of these
invariants are ORDERING, which is exactly the kind of thing a later edit breaks
silently: a gate moved below K$SET.USERNAME still compiles, still looks right in
a diff, and admits a session that has already become the user.

***AND THE CHECKS ARE THEMSELVES CHECKED.***  --selftest mutates the source in
the ways this gate could plausibly be broken and requires each mutation to be
CAUGHT.  A structural test nobody has driven against a broken input is the
"test that passes because it did nothing" CLAUDE.md names: it would pass just as
happily against a file it had failed to understand.
