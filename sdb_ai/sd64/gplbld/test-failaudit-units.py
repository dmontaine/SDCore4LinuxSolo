"""test-failaudit-units.py - a refused API login is audited BEFORE the failed-credential delay (S.60).

  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-failaudit-units.py
  python3 .../test-failaudit-units.py --selftest

No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 it could not run.  Written 4 Oct 26.

THE DEFECT (measured on Debian 13 and Fedora 44, 4 Oct 2026): scram.bad.cred in APISRVR did "sleep 3" and then went to
exit.vb.scram.fail, the one place a refused login is written to the audit trail.  A client that dropped the connection
during those three seconds ended the process before the audit line was written: five of five drops at 0.6-2.5 s left no
record, while a client that waited left one.  Anyone guessing passwords over the API could therefore choose not to be
recorded.  The fix keeps the delay and takes it AFTER the record.

***WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT.***  It reads sdsys/gpl.bp/apisrvr as text and cannot say the audit line is written; that is
measured on an install by witness-release-run.sh row A3d (the client is killed during the delay and the line must still
appear).  It says the ordering is still written, so a later edit that moves the sleep back above the record fails here
before anyone installs it.  --selftest mutates the source four ways and requires each to be caught.
