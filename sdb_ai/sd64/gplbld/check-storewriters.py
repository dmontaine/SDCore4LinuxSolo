# check-storewriters.py - does every program that WRITES a root-only system
#                         store run with euid 0?  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22, the
#                         port's verify-sdsyswrite re-expressed for Linux.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/check-storewriters.py
#   python3 .../check-storewriters.py --selftest
#
# No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 every writer is privileged, 1 a writer is
# not, 2 the check could not run (or found nothing to check).
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT CATCHES
# ===========================================================================
# The port's PRE_RELEASE_FIXES 68: an administrative verb whose store write was
# a plain openpath/write by the SD process, in a session whose token never had
# the right to it - so the verb "worked" through its helper half and silently
# failed its file half.  On Linux the shape is the euid.  A "sudo sd" session
# drops to euid sdsys at entry (CPROC's root-entry block, !EUID_SET), and CPROC
# raises it back to 0 only around the verbs in privileged_commands.  accounts
# and $cred are root-owned (installsdai.sh), so a write to either from any
# other verb fails however administrative the session is.
#
# WHY A STATIC CHECK AND NOT ONLY A WITNESS.  The witness (witness-release-run.sh
# section 13g) proves the four verbs that exist today land their writes.  It
# cannot see the fifth verb somebody adds tomorrow.  This reads the source, so
# it runs on every change, which is when that verb would appear.
#
# ===========================================================================
# HOW IT DECIDES
# ===========================================================================
# 1. STORES: the root-owned directories in the system tree, named below with the
#    installer line that makes them so.  Printed.
# 2. WRITERS: a gpl.bp record that opens one of them - openpath @sdsys:@ds:'x'
#    to VAR - and then writes or deletes on THAT variable (write/writeu/writev/
#    writevu/matwrite ... to|on VAR, delete VAR).  Reading is not writing: LOGIN,
#    TIERGATE and APISRVR open the register and are rightly not writers.
# 3. CALLERS: a writer catalogued as a subroutine (!NAME) is followed to every
#    record that calls it (call !NAME, or deffun ... calling '!NAME'), until a
#    verb ($NAME) is reached.  A subroutine nobody calls is reported, not passed.
# 4. VERDICT: each verb reached must be in CPROC's privileged_commands.
#
# ***IT REFUSES THE NULL CASE OUT LOUD.***  No stores found on disk, no writers
# found, or an empty privileged_commands list each exit 2: a sweep that found
# nothing cannot tell "all privileged" from "looked in the wrong place".
#
# LIMITS, STATED: a write through a file variable passed in from elsewhere, or a
# store path built at run time rather than written literally, is invisible to
# this.  None exists today (the sweep prints every openpath it saw).
