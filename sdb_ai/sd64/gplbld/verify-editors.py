# sd sessions that only reach refusal paths.  Exit 0 / 1 / 2 as the others.
#
# ***IT FAILS THE QUIET WAY, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON IT IS WORTH A STEP.***
# That is the port's argument and it transfers exactly.  If the nanorc stopped
# being installed, or /etc/nanorc's include were commented out, or the micro
# syntax master moved, ***NOTHING WOULD BREAK***: nano and micro would still
# open the record and every verb would go on working, against an editor with no
# SD BASIC highlighting at all.  There would be no error, no status and no log
# line - only a feature quietly absent. A defect with no symptom is the kind
# that comes back unnoticed, so it needs an instrument rather than a memory.
#
# ***THE PORT'S QUESTION DOES NOT TRANSFER WHOLE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE
# POINT.***  SD Core for Windows BUNDLES micro and Microsoft Edit into
# {app}\usr\bin, SHA-256 pinned, because its defect 66 was that they used to be
# DOWNLOADED at install time and a user got whatever winget had that day; its
# verifier therefore asks "is the bundled copy the one EDIT resolves, rather
# than whatever is on PATH".  ***HERE THEY ARE NOT BUNDLED AND DELIBERATELY
# SO*** - Microsoft Edit is not packaged for Linux, nano replaces it (owner,
# 10 Sep 2026), and both come from the distribution.  find.editor is
# "command -v" with an ABSOLUTE path required (EDIT:394-397).  So the Linux
# question is not "which copy" but "is there one at all, and is the SYNTAX
# CONFIGURATION - the part this project actually ships - placed where the
# editor will read it".
#
# ***AND ONE ROW IS A GAP THE PORT DOES NOT HAVE: A2.***  Shipping
# /usr/share/nano/sdbasic.nanorc achieves nothing unless /etc/nanorc INCLUDES
# it, and that include is Debian's file, not this project's - a distribution
# change or a local edit could comment it out and the install would go on
# succeeding.  A2 reads the include and requires it to be UNCOMMENTED and to
# glob-match the file actually installed.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT COVER, SAID OUT LOUD RATHER THAN SCORED.  Nobody can drive a
# full-screen editor down a pipe, so the things a person sees - colour on the
# screen, a "~~" mark surviving a round trip through the editor, the working
# copy being removed on exit - are NOT tested here.  What IS tested is
# everything that happens before the screen is drawn, and the refusal that
# happens INSTEAD of drawing it.
