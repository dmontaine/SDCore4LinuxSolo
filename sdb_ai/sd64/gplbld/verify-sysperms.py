# verify-sysperms.py - can an ordinary SD user write into the system tree, read
#                      the audit trail, or reach SDSYS?  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22,
#                      ranked item 7: the port's ACL family (verify-sysdiracl,
#                      verify-pcodeacl, verify-sdsysgate, verify-sdsyswrite,
#                      verify-accountacl, verify-catgate) re-expressed as Linux
#                      mode, ownership and group.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/verify-sysperms.py
#   python3 .../verify-sysperms.py --allow-stale      measure a stale install
#
# NO SUDO, AND NOT AS A CONVENIENCE.  Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a
# decisive check failed, 2 the test could not be run.
#
# ***THE DECISIVE CHECK IS THE WRITE, NOT THE MODE BITS.***  That is the port's
# rule (verify-sysdiracl: "an ACL can be read wrong ... an icacls that has
# itself been DENIED prints nothing and reads as (none), which scored a false
# clean on 24 Aug 2026") and it transfers intact: mode 0755 does not settle
# what a caller may do, because supplementary groups, a POSIX ACL set with
# setfacl, the setgid bit and an immutable attribute all change the answer
# without changing the four digits.  So every row below ASKS THE FILESYSTEM the
# question an attacker would ask, and the owner/group/mode is printed beside it
# as DIAGNOSIS ONLY.
#
# ***WHO RUNS IT DECIDES WHAT A REFUSAL MEANS, SO IT REFUSES TWO CALLERS.***
#   * root - every write would succeed and every row would pass for the wrong
#     reason.  This is the whole of why the port's equivalents refuse
#     elevation.
#   * anyone not in `sdusers` - their refusals come from the "other" bits,
#     which is a WEAKER claim wearing the same word.  The question is what a
#     member of the SD user group can do, so measuring a non-member would
#     overstate the protection.  Section 0 prints the caller's full group list
#     because that, not the mode, is the other half of every answer here.
#
# ***THE WRITABLE CONTROL IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND ITS REASON IS MEASURED RATHER
# THAN INHERITED.***  Without a row that must come back WRITABLE this file
# passes in two opposite worlds: one where the tree is correctly locked, and
# one where something locked EVERYTHING and every session is broken.  The port
# uses $ipc and says why - every session modifies $ipc/%0.  Row W2 does not
# take that on trust: it stats $IPC/%0, runs a session, and stats it again.
# Measured 12 Sep 2026 on this install, the mtime advanced.
#
# ***AND THE READ-ONLY SET IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED.***  Everything in the system
# directory must refuse a write EXCEPT the names in EXPECT_WRITABLE below, each
# of which carries a reason and a citation.  A directory that arrives
# group-writable in some future install turns this red without anybody having
# remembered to add it - the same shape as verify-basicfuncs's coverage row,
# and for the same reason: a list somebody must maintain is a list that goes
# stale in silence.
