#
# 14 Sep 2026 - THE CONTROL ROWS WERE REWRITTEN WHEN MODIFY.PASSWORD BECAME THE
# WINDOWS PORT'S (W.4 SCRAM phase 2).  It no longer runs passwd(1): it sets SD's
# own API credential in $cred, which is root:root 0700, and CPROC gives it
# euid 0 only in a root session.  So an unprivileged run can no longer reach a
# password prompt at all - the old C1-C5 (PAM refusing a wrong current
# password) measured behaviour that was deliberately removed, and would have
# failed for that reason alone.
#
# ***THE CONTROL IS STILL THE WHOLE POINT, AND IT IS THE PORT'S POINT.***  "It
# refused" proves nothing on its own - a verb that refused EVERYTHING would
# score every refusal row a pass.  So the same command without the extra token
# has to get PAST the syntax check and the privilege check and reach the
# credential register's gate.  As an ordinary session it is then refused THERE,
# with "MODIFY.PASSWORD needs sudo sd" - the port's "ordinary console NO,
# deliberately" (its secure-cred.ps1).  Rows C1-C4 are that control: C2 shows
# the gate was reached, C3 that nothing was set and no password asked for, C4
# that the register is root-only.
#
# ***C2 AND C3 FAILED ON THEIR FIRST RUN, 14 Sep 2026 on 74c60d4, AND THE
# PRODUCT WAS WRONG, NOT THE INSTRUMENT.***  They expected "Cannot open the
# $cred register"; the verb instead said "has no password set" and prompted,
# because a directory file opens without permission and the refused read looks
# like a missing record.  SET_ACC_PASSWORD now refuses on the real uid before
# any prompt, and C2 matches that refusal's wording.
#
# ***WHAT AN UNPRIVILEGED RUN CANNOT REACH, SAID OUT LOUD RATHER THAN SCORED
# AS A PASS.***  SET_ACC_PASSWORD tests in this order: trailing token (5276),
# then "not own and not administrator" (2001), then "not in the register"
# (5018), then the $cred open.  Because the privilege test comes SECOND, a
# non-administrator naming ANY account but their own is refused 2001 and never
# reaches 5018.  ***SO 5018 AND THE CREDENTIAL WRITE ARE NOT REACHABLE FROM THIS
# FILE*** - they need "sudo sd", and witness-release-run.sh section 13 measures
# the write (C0-C7).
#
# ***THE ORDERING ITSELF IS A CHECK, AND IT IS ROW T3.***  "MODIFY.PASSWORD
# <peer> somethingextra" must answer 5276 and NOT 2001.  If it answered 2001
# the refusal would be about privilege rather than about grammar, and T1 would
# no longer prove what it claims.
#
# ***AND THE NULL CASE HAS ITS OWN ROW, N1.***  If MODIFY.PASSWORD were not in
# this account's VOC, every refusal row would "pass" for the wrong reason: SD
# answers "<verb> is not in your VOC", which contains none of the message text
# the disqualifiers look for.  N1 reads the VOC record, and every treatment row
# also carries "is not in your VOC" as a disqualifier.
