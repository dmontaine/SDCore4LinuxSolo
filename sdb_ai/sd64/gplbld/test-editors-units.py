#
# ***WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND THE OTHER VERIFIERS DO NOT ALL HAVE ONE.***
# verify-vocverbs and verify-txn can be shown to go red against the SYSTEM - an
# older install, or a deliberately broken probe.  verify-editors cannot: every
# row it checks is a root-owned file (/etc/nanorc, /usr/share/nano, the
# installed sdsys tree), and breaking one to watch the check fail would mean
# editing the machine's own configuration.  ***SO THE RED IS DEMONSTRATED
# AGAINST THE LOGIC INSTEAD***, with the inputs the real files would have if
# they regressed.
#
# ***THE LOAD-BEARING CASE IS THE COMMENTED-OUT include.***  Debian's shipped
# /etc/nanorc carries the live include on line 257 and THREE COMMENTED ONES
# immediately below it.  A substring search for the filename - the obvious way
# to write that check - finds a commented line and reports the highlighting as
# reachable when nano never reads it.  That is a false "current" in the same
# shape as every other one this project has paid for, and it is the reason A2
# parses the line rather than searching it.
