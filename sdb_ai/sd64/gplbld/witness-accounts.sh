# ===========================================================================
# WHAT THE FIRST VERSION GOT WRONG, 12 Sep 2026 17:57 - KEPT, BECAUSE THE
# REASON IS THE LESSON
# ===========================================================================
# The first --commit run scored "13 passed, 7 failed", and BOTH NUMBERS WERE
# WRONG ABOUT WHAT THEY MEANT.
#
#   * THE 7 FAILURES WERE ONE BAD PREMISE, AND IT WAS THIS SCRIPT'S.  Phase 2
#     created a Linux user with useradd and then ran
#     "CREATE.ACCOUNT USER zzacct2 NO.QUERY", expecting an account.  SD
#     refused it with 10038 - "SD accounts create their own Linux user" - and
#     SD was RIGHT: since 11 Sep (CREATEA:21-27) a pre-existing Linux user is
#     refused rather than silently taken over, and ADOPT is the one sanctioned
#     exception.  The premise came from a 10 Sep recipe in PROJECT_STATUS that
#     predates that change.  ***THE CHANGE WAS DOCUMENTED IN THE FILE BEING
#     SCRIPTED AGAINST, AND IN PROJECT_STATUS'S OWN QUEUE 15 WITNESS, AND
#     NEITHER WAS READ FIRST.***
#   * ***8 OF THE 13 PASSES WERE THE NULL CASE.***  Nothing was created, so
#     "the register record is gone", "the directory is gone", "the Linux user
#     survives" and "it did not offer to delete the Linux user" were all true
#     of an account that never existed.  Only phase 1's five rows measured
#     anything.  THE FIX IS NEVER THE ONE-LINE CAUSE: the premise was the
#     cause, but what would have caught it is GATING - a phase whose
#     precondition was not established must not run, and its rows must count
#     as NOT REACHED, which is a failure.  Every phase below is gated.
#   * AND THE UNGATED PHASE LEAKED ITS ANSWER.  DELETE.ACCOUNT refused an
#     unregistered name without asking anything, so the "Y" meant for its
#     confirmation reached the ":" prompt as a command - "Y is not in your
#     VOC".  Harmless because Y is not a verb; the shape is not harmless.
#     Phase 3 now runs only against a registered account, and row D6 checks
#     that the Y was consumed by the confirmation.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT IT MEASURES NOW (18 Sep 26, AFTER THE TEARDOWN)
# ===========================================================================
#   1   NO.QUERY without a Linux user is refused (10039): SD accounts create
#       their own Linux user, and creating one means setting its password.
#   2a  A pre-existing Linux user WITHOUT ADOPT is refused (10038) and nothing
#       is made.  ADOPT is now install-only (the teardown, S.26: a root
#       session is refused outright, and -internal is root-only), so the
#       borrowed-user route cannot exist on a delivered machine - 2a is the
#       control that says so, and this script no longer drives an ADOPT.
#   2b  CREATE.ACCOUNT USER <name>, SD's whole flow: it creates the Linux
#       user itself and asks for that user's password (answered from a pipe,
#       thrown away, never printed).  Checked: a plain account - three
#       register fields, no tier, no suspension, in sdusers only.
#   3   DELETE.ACCOUNT on the account SD created: the SD-created branch -
#       the LONGER confirmation (10084, naming the Linux user), the data
#       warning (10158), and 10028 "OS User: <name> Deleted".  The Linux
#       user and its home go with it.
#
# THE SESSIONS RUN AS SDSYS, THE ONE ADMINISTRATOR (S.26): a local session
# running as the sdsys OS user is the only thing CPROC grants, and the only
# thing CREATE.ACCOUNT and DELETE.ACCOUNT accept.
#
# NOT HERE, BY RULING: the borrowed-user branch.  It was the ADOPT flow, and
# the teardown closed it - witness-absence.sh says the closing.
#
# THE PIPED-SESSION RULES ARE THE PROJECT'S:
#   * a blank first line absorbs anything emitted before the first prompt;
#   * TERM 200,9999 stops pagination;
#   * every session ends in OFF;
#   * a verb that prompts EATS THE NEXT LINE - and a prompt that never appears
#     leaves its answer for the ":" prompt (the 12 Sep 17:57 run);
#   * password answers are never echoed into the log: run_sd prints
#     "(password answer)" in their place.
#   * OBSERVED 12 Sep 17:57: with a terminal attached, sd writes its command
#     echo straight to the TTY, so ":TERM 200,9999" appears unprefixed on
#     screen and is NOT in the captured text.  Nothing below anchors on echo
#     text.
#
set -u

# The script names itself by absolute path, every variable expanded - the
# re-run command it prints lands in somebody else's shell.
