# Exit 0 the install is current, 1 it is STALE, 2 the question CANNOT BE
# ANSWERED.  Those are three answers, not two, and collapsing the third into
# either of the others is the defect this file is most likely to grow.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS CODE RATHER THAN A RULE.  CLAUDE.md has required since the
# port's rule of 15 Aug 2026 that a test cycle begin with a fresh install, and
# says of this project: "nothing checks, so the discipline is yours.  Writing
# that guard is worth a session."  A rule says when a cycle BEGINS and says
# nothing about what ENDS one, so "install, start testing, edit source, keep
# reading results" obeys it while producing measurements of a tree that no
# longer exists.  A result from a stale tree is worse than no result: it looks
# like evidence.
#
# ***THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT THE PORT'S QUESTION, AND COPYING ITS ANSWER WOULD
# BE WRONG.***  assert-current.ps1 compares the installed binary with bin\sd.exe
# because there the installer stages what is in bin\.  ***HERE THE INSTALLER
# CLONES main FROM GITHUB AND BUILDS THAT*** (owner, 9 Sep 2026; CLAUDE.md
# "Project constraints"; PRE_RELEASE 15).  So bin/sd in the working tree is NOT
# what got installed even when both are perfectly current, and comparing them
# would report stale on a good tree and current on a bad one.
#
# The Linux question has three parts and they fail for different reasons:
#
#   A. Is the working tree committed?      An uncommitted change cannot be in
#                                          an install, because the installer
#                                          never sees the working tree.
#   B. Is HEAD pushed to origin/main?      Same reason, one step further out.
#   C. Was the install built from HEAD?    Exact when the install left a stamp;
#                                          one-directional without one.
#   D. Is bin/sd newer than gplsrc?        A DIFFERENT question - it is about
#                                          the tree you compile BASIC against,
#                                          not the one you measure.  Kept
#                                          because it is the port's check A2,
#                                          which was paid for: a C edit reached
#                                          a commit having never been compiled.
#
# THE BIAS IS DELIBERATE AND IT IS THE PORT'S.  A false "stale" costs one
# install; a false "current" costs an investigation into a bug that was fixed
# hours ago.  So anything that cannot be shown to be current is not current.
#
# ***OWNER'S RULING, 12 SEP 2026: CHECK C STAYS STRICT COMMIT IDENTITY. DO NOT
# MAKE IT CLEVERER.***  The question had been put: C compares the install's
# stamp with HEAD, so ANY commit makes it STALE - including a
# documentation-only one - and every verifier then needs its --allow-stale
# flag.  The proposal was to have C ask instead whether the delta touches
# anything the install actually CONTAINS.  ***THE RULING WAS FOR THE MOST
# TRUSTED OPTION, WHICH IS THIS ONE***, and the reason is the paragraph above:
# a cleverer C would have to decide, per commit, which files reach an install,
# and every wrong answer in that decision is a FALSE "current" - the expensive
# direction.  A blunt check that is sometimes pessimistic cannot lie in the
# direction that costs.
#
# ***RE-PROPOSED AND REAFFIRMED THE SAME DAY (12 Sep 2026, late):*** a session
# suggested exempting commits that change only .md files - measured true today,
# no .md reaches an install - without first reading this header.  The owner
# chose strict again.  Do not propose it a third time; fix the friction on the
# CALLER'S side instead - do not commit witness records between an install's
# test runs, and state the delta out loud when --allow-stale is used.
#
# SO THE FRICTION IS PAID WHERE IT IS VISIBLE INSTEAD.  A caller who has
# reasoned about the delta says so out loud with its own --allow-stale, which
# prints a banner, and states the commit and the reason when quoting the
# result.  ***THE REASONING IS THEN IN THE TRANSCRIPT RATHER THAN INSIDE THIS
# FILE***, where nobody would see it.  The port's $neverShipped list is NOT
# the same mechanism and does not answer this: it is about a FILE existing,
# not about a COMMIT differing.
