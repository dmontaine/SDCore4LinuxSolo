#
# WHAT IS WRONG.  @SDSYS/ACCOUNTS is the account register and nothing ever
# reconciles it against the operating system.  A Linux user can be removed from
# OUTSIDE SD - userdel, a decommission script, a directory change - and nothing
# in SD is consulted, so the record outlives the user.  LIST SD.ACCOUNTS then
# answers wrongly, and CREATE.ACCOUNT refuses to recreate the name: true of the
# record and false of the world.
#
# THE RULING IS ON THE FILE, NOT ON ITS READERS.  Owner to the port, 1 Sep 2026:
# "the ACCOUNTS directory should contain no deleted accounts - there should be
# NO invalid records in it."  So this is not a reconcile-on-read and not a
# truer message at one caller: the register is the inventory, and an inventory
# with invalid rows is wrong however it is read.
#
# ***AND REMOVING THE DIRECTORY IS NOT A HARD CALL, BECAUSE THE MODEL ALREADY
# HAS A PLACE FOR "KEEP THE DATA".***  Owner, 12 Sep 2026: "this is why
# suspended accounts exist - you want to retain data, suspend the account; you
# want everything deleted, delete the account."  A stale record means somebody
# DELETED the Linux user, which is the second of those, so taking the directory
# with it is carrying out the intent rather than destroying something a person
# meant to keep.  ***SO THE ONLY QUESTION THIS FILE HAS TO GET RIGHT IS "IS THE
# USER REALLY GONE", NOT "SHOULD A GONE USER'S DIRECTORY GO"*** - which is why
# every guard below is about the reliability of that one lookup, and none of
# them is about second-guessing the removal.
#
# ======================================================================
#   THE LINUX HAZARD THE PORT DOES NOT HAVE - READ THIS BEFORE --sweep
# ======================================================================
#
# ***SD'S OWN IDEA OF "THIS USER EXISTS" IS NARROWER THAN THE SYSTEM'S, AND THE
# GAP IS INVISIBLE UNTIL IT IS NOT.***  !is_user (GPL.BP/IS_USER:52) does
# openpath "/etc" and reads "passwd" DIRECTLY.  It never consults NSS.  This
# machine's /etc/nsswitch.conf reads "passwd: files systemd sss" and sssd is
# ENABLED though currently inactive (measured 12 Sep 2026), so a domain-joined
# install has users that the system resolves and SD cannot see at all.
#
# A sweep keyed on SD's view would therefore mark EVERY directory-backed
# account stale and delete its directory.  That is the expensive version of
# PRE_RELEASE 96's defect, and it is why this file asks TWO sources and acts
# only when they agree that the user is gone:
#
#   getent says yes, /etc/passwd says yes   live, not stale
#   getent says no,  /etc/passwd says no    definitely absent - the only
#                                           case that is ever acted on
#   getent says yes, /etc/passwd says no    directory-backed user: the system
#                                           has them and SD cannot see them.
#                                           REFUSED, and reported, because it
#                                           is a real problem of its own
#   getent fails / disagrees the other way  could not tell.  REFUSED
#
# ======================================================================
#   THE THREE RULES CARRIED FROM THE PORT
# ======================================================================
#
# 1. AN ACCOUNT WITH NO LINUX USER IS NOT NECESSARILY A STALE ACCOUNT, AND THE
#    REGISTER SAYS SO ITSELF.  CREATE.ACCOUNT has three types and only USER has
#    a login.  ACC$GROUP (field 3) is "sdu_<login>" for a USER account and the
#    group's own name otherwise, so it identifies the type AND carries the
#    login.  SDSYS's record says "sdsys" and is exempt by that rule rather than
#    by its name - the name is checked too, as a second row, because the port's
#    own first attempt marked SDSYS dead.
#
# 2. "I COULD NOT TELL" IS NOT "NO".  Every lookup reports three states and
#    only the middle one is acted on.  There is a control as well: the account
#    enumeration must succeed and be plausibly sized before any verdict is
#    believed, because a machine with almost no accounts does not exist and an
#    empty answer is a broken instrument rather than an empty register.
#
# 3. BOTH HALVES OR NEITHER, AND THE DIRECTORY FIRST.  The record is the only
#    handle anything else has on the directory, so removing it first would
#    strand a directory nobody can find again.  A record whose directory would
#    not go is kept and reported, and the next run tries again.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES TO TOUCH - each skipped BY NAME, never in silence, so the next
# run reports it again rather than a person having to notice a quiet:
#
#   the lookup did not complete             a name service that is down
#   the two sources disagree                directory-backed, or worse
#   the record id is an escaped file name   %E/%G/%L, not decoded here
#   ACC$GROUP does not begin sdu_           GROUP, OTHER, SDSYS: no login
#   the account is named SDSYS              the same, said by name
#   the user still resolves                 not stale at all
#   field 1 is not <root>/<id downcased>    a record pointing somewhere else
#   the path IS the accounts root           or the root itself
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.  The sdu_<name> GROUP is left alone: the
# ruling names the record and the directory, a group is not part of the
# register, and over-deleting as root is the worse failure.  A surviving group
# is reported against the record and left for a person.
