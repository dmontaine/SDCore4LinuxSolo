"""test-batchgate-units.py - the batch-job command-line gate, as invariants.

  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-batchgate-units.py
  python3 .../test-batchgate-units.py --selftest

No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 all checks passed, 1 a check failed, 2 it
could not run.  Written 20 Sep 26 for S.40 (parity with the Windows port,
owner's ruling: a behavior prevented on one port must be prevented on both).

***WHAT THIS IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT.*** It reads sdsys/gpl.bp/login and the two
installer scripts as TEXT.  ***IT CANNOT SAY THE GATE REFUSES ANYBODY*** - only
that the gate is still written, still ordered correctly, and still shaped the
way S.40 needs.  GPL.BP cannot be compiled without an install (the two-stage
bootstrap, CLAUDE.md "Testing"), so a reader is the only guard on this between
cycles - exactly the shape test-apiroute-units.py already established for
S.29's sdapi gate, and this test follows the same pattern for the same reason.
The refusal itself is owed a witness row on the next cycle: a session invoked
as a single command line, unlisted and unelevated, must be refused 11000/11001/
11002 and never reach proc.sentence.

***AND THE CHECKS ARE THEMSELVES CHECKED.*** --selftest mutates the source in
the ways this gate could plausibly be broken and requires each mutation to be
CAUGHT - a structural test nobody has driven against a broken input is the
"test that passes because it did nothing" CLAUDE.md names.
