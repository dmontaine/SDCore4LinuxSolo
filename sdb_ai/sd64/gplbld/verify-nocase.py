# verify-nocase.py - the §M scope meter: every name in the SOURCE tree that is
#                    still upper case, by category.  PORT_ADOPTION queue 18; the
#                    owner's ruling of 11 Sep 2026, "everything lowercase so we
#                    don't have commands, files or record ids that differ only
#                    in casing."
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/verify-nocase.py
#   python3 .../verify-nocase.py --list        also print every remnant name
#   python3 .../verify-nocase.py --strict      exit 1 unless the name half is COMPLETE
#
# NO SUDO, NO INSTALL, NO sd.  It reads the source tree only, because §M is a
# change to what ships, and the migration is verified by reinstall afterwards.
# Exit 0 the audit ran (whatever it found), 1 only under --strict with remnants
# left, 2 it could not run (a path it measures is missing).
#
# ***THIS INSTRUMENT IS RED BY DESIGN UNTIL §M IS DONE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.***
# It does not "pass" today - nothing of §M is built.  It measures the scope and
# names what is left, and it reads zero when the name half of §M is complete.
# So it is a gate for a migration, not a check of finished behaviour: the number
# it reports going to 0 IS the definition of done for the part it covers.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS "STILL UPPER CASE", AND WHY THE ESCAPES ARE NOT.  A record id
# containing a restricted character is stored as a filename of "%" plus a
# substitute letter - sd.h:113-114 maps each of  *,=><%/+:;?\"  to  ACEGLPSVXYZBQ
# and a leading "." or "~" to %d / %t.  So "%E" on disk is the record "=", not a
# name called E; "#" and "&" are symbol record ids with no letters at all.  The
# test therefore STRIPS every "%<letter>" escape and only then looks for [A-Z]:
# a name needs lowercasing only if a real, unescaped upper-case letter survives.
# Measured 12 Sep 2026: this correctly passes over %E %E%G %P %t # & and flags
# ACCOUNTS, $ACC, INT$KEYS.H.
#
# ***WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MEASURE, BECAUSE THE OWNER HAS NOT RULED IT.***
# Two categories are open (PORT_ADOPTION queue 18), and guessing either way
# would be a false positive with a check's name on it:
#   * ACCOUNT NAMES - KEYS.H:263 "forced to uppercase"; the gap table marks this
#     RE-RULE.  Lowercasing account ids is not assumed.
#   * RECORD IDS IN A USER'S OWN DATA FILES - on ext4 "SUE" and "sue" are two
#     files, so forcing an application's data ids to lower case would change its
#     data.  Out of scope until ruled.
# They are printed as DEFERRED so the reader sees they were considered, not
# missed.
#
# ***AND IT MEASURES NAMES, NOT THE ON-THE-FLY UPCASING HALF OF §M.***  The
# ruling has two halves: names lowercased, AND input upper-cased on the fly so a
# command typed in caps still resolves.  A static name audit cannot prove the
# second; the known code sites that must change are listed as a checklist
# (CREATEF's upcase(file.name), LOGIN's PT$INVERT), not asserted green.
