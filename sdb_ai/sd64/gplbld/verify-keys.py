# verify-keys.py - does the backspace key erase a character at the command line,
#                  whichever byte the terminal sends for it, under a terminal
#                  type that names the other one?  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22, the
#                  port's verify-keys.ps1 (its PROJECT_STATUS 5.17).
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/verify-keys.py
#   python3 .../verify-keys.py --allow-stale     measure a stale install
#
# NO SUDO.  Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a decisive check failed,
# 2 the test could not be run.
#
# THE DEFECT.  A terminal sends Ctrl-H (8) or DEL (127) for backspace.  _keycode
# bound only the byte the terminal type's kbs named, so the key did nothing on a
# terminal that disagreed with its type.  MEASURED 14 Sep 2026 on install
# d704658: after TERM vt100 (kbs ^H), DEL did NOT erase; under linux (the default
# type here) and xterm both bytes did.  Linux emulators send DEL by default.
# _keycode now binds both bytes before the terminfo binds (the port's fix).
#
# THE INSTRUMENT IS WHAT SD EXECUTES, not what it echoes (the port's design).
# "COUNTX<erase> VOC" runs COUNT VOC and answers "N record(s) counted" if the
# erase worked, and "COUNTX is not in your VOC" if it did not - two different
# answers, so a row cannot pass by accident.
#
# ***THE TYPE IS SET INSIDE THE SESSION, AND CONFIRMED.***  SD ignores the
# environment's TERM here - measured: TERM=vt100 in the environment still gave
# "Device : linux".  So each session sends TERM <type> and then TERM, and the
# "Device" line must name the type asked for, or that row measured the wrong
# terminal and is refused.
#
# THE CONTROL sends no erase at all and must get "not in your VOC" under every
# type; without it, a VOC that happened to hold COUNTX would pass everything.
