# test-scram-vectors.py - compiles and runs both SCRAM vector tests: the SERVER
# primitives (gplbld/verify-scram.c with gplsrc/sd_scram.c, against libsodium)
# and the CLIENT primitives (gplbld/verify-scramclient.c with
# gplsrc/scram_client.h, no library).  RFC 7677 section 3 vectors, the
# verification path and the guards.  Added 14 Sep 2026 with W.4 phase 1; the
# client half joined with phase 4, the same day.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-scram-vectors.py
#
# No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 every check passed, 1 a check failed,
# 2 it could not run (no compiler, no libsodium, a compile error).
#
# THE NULL CASE IS REFUSED, per program: each one's own summary line must say
# how many checks ran, the count must be above zero, and none may have failed -
# a program that compiled and printed nothing, or ran no checks, is not a pass.
