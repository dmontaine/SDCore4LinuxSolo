# ***THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT OF THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE PORT'S OWN
# SENTENCE: "proving three verbs are absent is easy and proves little - a
# botched removal that took APISRVR or the catalogue with it would pass every
# 'is it gone?' check ever written."***  So section 2 asks what SURVIVED, and
# it is not decoration: a green section 1 with a red section 2 is a disaster,
# and a file that only had section 1 would call it a success.
#
# ***AND THIS PROJECT HAS A SHARPER CONTROL THAN THE PORT DOES, BECAUSE IT HAS
# A DOCUMENTED NEAR-MISS TRAP.***  CLAUDE.md, "Conventions": *"Mind the
# near-miss names.  GPL.BP/MODIFY is the record editor and is being removed;
# GPL.BP/MODIFYA is MODIFY.ACCOUNT and stays.  MODIFY.PASSWORD stays."*  A
# removal keyed on the string "MODIFY" takes all three.  Rows B1-B3 are that
# trap, asserted rather than remembered.
#
# WHAT WENT, on the owner's stance of 8 Sep 2026: the TAPE/RESTORE subsystem,
# PROC, SED, UPDATE.RECORD, MODIFY, SDNet, the VFS scaffolding, OPGEN and the
# SDSYS BP test programs.  SDNet is the one with a security story: a VOC entry
# of the form "server;file" made op_dio1.c split on the semicolon and call
# net_open(), which read a user name and password from sd.conf - obscured by
# letter substitution, not encrypted - and connected on port 4245.
#
# ***THE KNOB SURVIVED THE MECHANISM, IN BOTH TREES, AND SECTION 3 IS ABOUT
# THAT.***  NETFILES is still parsed (config.c:219-220), still copied into
# shared memory (sysseg.c:217) and still reportable by CONFIG('NETFILES')
# (op_config.c:135) - and is consulted by NOTHING.  The port keeps it too
# (its config.c:276-277, header.h:64), so under the owner's conformance ruling
# it STAYS, and this file does not fail it.  What section 3 proves is the part
# that matters: ***the knob is inert.***  Setting NETFILES=1 cannot reach a
# remote file, because net_open, netfiles.c, the NET_FILE descriptor type and
# the semicolon dispatch are all gone.  A dead parameter is untidy; a live one
# nobody noticed would be a hole.
#
# WHY THE SEMICOLON CASE IS NOT EXERCISED, and the port says the same: reaching
# it needs a VOC F-pointer whose path contains a ";", and VOC is a hashed file,
# so a record cannot be planted from outside SD.  The branch that read the
# semicolon is deleted outright rather than disabled, so what is checked is
# that the code behind it is gone and that ordinary file access still works.
