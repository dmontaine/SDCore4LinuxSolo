# verify-lineendings.py - does READSEQ treat a CRLF as one terminator, keep a
#                         LONE CR as data, and get both right when the CRLF
#                         STRADDLES the 2048-byte buffer boundary?
#                         PORT_ADOPTION queue 22; intent from the port's

#
# ***THE STRADDLE CHECK IS THE REASON THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A ONE-LINER, AND
# IT IS THE PORT'S SENTENCE:*** every one of these readers is CHUNKED -
# `SEQ_BUFFER_SIZE` is 2048 (`op_seqio.c:67`) - so a CRLF can land with the CR
# ending one buffer and the LF starting the next.  ***A FIX THAT INSPECTS "THE
# BYTE BEFORE THE LF" IS CORRECT ON EVERY SMALL FIXTURE AND WRONG ABOUT ONCE
# PER 2 KB OF REAL DATA***, and the failure presents as stray CRs with no
# pattern.  No other check here would catch it.
#
# ***AND A LONE CR MUST SURVIVE, BECAUSE IT IS DATA AND NOT A TERMINATOR.***  A
# fix that stripped every CR would pass every other row in this file.  Fixture
# f5 puts a lone CR exactly AT the buffer boundary, which is where the
# straddle logic is holding a CR back and has to decide what it was: that is
# the subtlest case in the file and the one the two fixes can break together.
#
# ***WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, AND IT IS HALF THE PORT'S SCRIPT.***  The
# port also tests a DIRECTORY-FILE record written with CRLF, because on Windows
# external editors write CRLF and directory files exist to be edited by them.
# ***THIS TREE DOES NOT FOLD CR IN DIRECTORY FILES, ON PURPOSE*** -
# `op_dio3.c:1309`: *"there is nothing to fold on a bare-LF file, so that logic
# is deliberately not carried over"*.  Testing it here would assert behaviour
# the project has decided against.  ***THE ASSUMPTION IS ABOUT USERS RATHER
# THAN ABOUT THE PLATFORM*** - a Linux user can still hand a record CRLF, by an
# editor setting or by copying a file in from Windows - so it is logged in
# PROJECT_STATUS as wanting a ruling, not silently inherited.
#
# ***THE FIXTURES ARE WRITTEN BY THIS FILE, BYTE BY BYTE, AND THEN CHECKED
# BEFORE THEY ARE TRUSTED.***  No BASIC statement can place a byte at a precise
# offset, so the probe only exercises the READER.  Rows F3a/F3b/F5a read the
# bytes back off the disk and assert the CR really is the 2048th byte: ***an
# off-by-one fixture would make the straddle rows pass without testing a
# straddle at all***, which is the null case this file is most exposed to.
