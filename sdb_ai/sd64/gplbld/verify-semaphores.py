# verify-semaphores.py - does a session that dies HOLDING an SD semaphore give it
#                        back?  Task table W.0, owner's ruling of 14 Sep 2026:
#                        SEM_UNDO on the lock (sdsem.c) AND a release on the
#                        fatal-signal path (kernel.c fatal_signal_handler).
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/verify-semaphores.py
#   python3 .../verify-semaphores.py --allow-stale     measure a stale install
#
# NO SUDO.  Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a decisive check failed,
# 2 the test could not be run.
#
# ***DO NOT RUN THIS AGAINST AN INSTALL WITHOUT THE FIX.***  Before W.0 a session
# killed while holding a semaphore left it taken, and every SD process then spun
# for ever - the system-wide wedge of 11 Sep 2026, which needed a reboot.  This
# file sets out to kill a session at exactly that moment.  assert-current is
# enforced for that reason, not only for honesty.
#
# THE INSTRUMENT IS THE KERNEL'S OWN VIEW OF THE SET: `ipcs -s -i <semid>` prints
# each semaphore's value and the pid of its last operation, readable without
# sudo (the set is 0666).  An SD semaphore is a mutex: 1 free, 0 held.
#
# ***HOW IT CATCHES A HOLD, AND THE SAFETY RULE THAT GOES WITH IT.***  It starts
# its own piped sessions (as the caller, in the caller's account) that take
# semaphores constantly.  When a sample shows a value of 0 whose last operator
# is ONE OF ITS OWN SESSIONS, it SIGSTOPs that session and samples again; if the
# value is still 0 with the same pid, that session is frozen holding it - a
# CONFIRMED hold.  Then:
#   KILL round  SIGKILL it.  Nothing in SD runs; only the kernel's SEM_UNDO can
#               give the semaphore back.  The value must return to 1.
#   FAULT round SIGSEGV it, then SIGCONT.  fatal_signal_handler runs first and
#               releases what the owner table says it holds; the value must
#               return to 1 and must never reach 2 (a release of something not
#               held, or SEM_UNDO undoing a release the handler already made).
# ***IT NEVER SIGNALS A PROCESS IT DID NOT START***, and a stop that does not
# confirm is followed by SIGCONT at once.
#
# ***THE NULL CASE IS REFUSED OUT LOUD.***  Holds last microseconds and ipcs runs
# in milliseconds, so a round can end without catching one.  Such a round's
# release row FAILS as "no hold was caught" - it is not a pass.  Run it again.
#
# ***AND NO VALUE MAY EVER READ ABOVE 1***, in any sample of the whole run.  That
# is the risk the change itself carries: SEM_UNDO on one half of a lock/unlock
# pair and not the other, or a release of a semaphore that was not held, turns a
# mutex into a count of 2 - two holders at once - and nothing else would say so.
#
# Killed and faulted sessions leave user-table slots; sdlnxd reaps them within
# about a minute (sdlnxd.c:97, :134).  A SIGSEGV also writes "Fault type" to the
# error log.
