"""test-configpath-units.py - ONE variable and ONE default for the config file,
kept in step between the server and the client library.

  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-configpath-units.py
  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-configpath-units.py --selftest

No sudo, no install, no sd.  A free check.

WHY IT EXISTS.  The server read SCARLET_CONFIG (inipath.c) while the client
library read SD_CONFIG (sdclilib.c), with nothing anywhere saying the two had
to agree - so setting the variable you would expect configured exactly one of
them.  The Windows port hit this on 14 Aug 2026 and the owner's instruction
there was to stop reading SCARLET_CONFIG and settle on SD_CONFIG; that
decision is this port's decision too, and the rename landed here on 15 Sep
2026.  The two values now live in gplsrc/sddefs.h, and sdclilib.c carries its
own copy of them because the client is a separate toolchain that must not
include the server's headers.  NOTHING IN THE BUILD CROSS-CHECKS THAT COPY -
the compiler is happy either way, and the failure is silent at runtime.  That
is what this check is for.

WHAT IT PINS

  gplsrc/sddefs.h    SD_CONFIG_ENV "SD_CONFIG", SD_CONFIG_DEFAULT
                     "/etc/sd.conf"
  gplsrc/inipath.c   reads the SYMBOL SD_CONFIG_ENV, not a literal; bounds the
                     copy at MAX_PATHNAME_LEN + 1; no strcpy into the caller's
                     buffer
  gplsrc/sdclilib.c  its duplicated literals equal sddefs.h's two values
  gplsrc/sdfix.c     read_sdconfig()'s buffer is MAX_PATHNAME_LEN + 1, which
                     is what every other GetConfigPath() caller passes - it
                     was 201 bytes, so the function's contract was whatever
                     the smallest caller happened to be
  gplsrc/*.c, *.h    SCARLET_CONFIG appears in no CODE anywhere (comments
                     explaining the history are allowed, and expected)

CONTROLS.  Every value must be FOUND, so a renamed or deleted definition fails
loudly rather than passing on nothing; the run refuses if fewer checks ran
than expected; and --selftest mutates each pinned fact in memory and requires
the check to go red for it, so a check that cannot fail is itself a failure.

Exit 0 all agree, 1 a mismatch or something not found, 2 it could not run.
