# mkbasicsyntax.py - build micro's SD BASIC syntax file FROM BCOMP.

#
# THE WORD LISTS ARE NOT TYPED OUT.  BCOMP is the compiler: its own tables say
# what a statement is, what a reserved word is and what an intrinsic function
# is.  Reading them means the highlighting cannot drift from the language, and
# it means nobody has to proof-read 400 names.
#
# It prints what it extracted and refuses a list that came back empty - a
# syntax file built from nothing would highlight nothing and look like a
# working file.  Validate the result with gplbld/checksyntax.py, which catches
# the two faults micro reports by simply not highlighting.
#
# Ported from SD Core for Windows (its gplbld/mkbasicsyntax.py) on the owner's
# ruling of 9 Sep 2026: drop Microsoft Edit here, keep micro at whatever version
# the distribution ships, and KEEP THE SD BASIC SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING.  Only the
# embedded YAML header changed - the extraction is the port's.
#
# ***RUN AT BUILD TIME, NEVER AT INSTALL TIME, AND THE REASON IS NOT STYLE.***
# It reads sdsys/gpl.bp/bcomp, which is the SOURCE tree's compiler.  An
# installed system has one too, so the command would appear to work there and
# would silently describe whatever that install happens to be.  Regenerate when
# BCOMP's tables change; the counts it prints are how you tell that they did.

# distributions' repositories - and micro is whatever version the distribution
# ships.  The NANO verb runs nano here (owner, 10 Sep 2026), whose SD BASIC
# syntax is gplbld/nanocfg/sdbasic.nanorc, from gplbld/mknanosyntax.py.
