# verify-accounts.py - is the account register true about the operating system,
#                      and do the account verbs refuse a session that is not
#                      the administrator?  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22, ranked item 6
#                      - the NO-SUDO HALF of the port's account family
#                      (verify-createaccount, verify-delaccount,
#                      verify-acctmsgs, verify-accountrules).
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/verify-accounts.py
#   python3 .../verify-accounts.py --allow-stale      measure a stale install
#
# NO SUDO.  Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a decisive check failed,
# 2 the test could not be run.
#
# ***WHY IT IS A HALF, AND THE SPLIT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.***  The
# port's four scripts CREATE and DELETE a throwaway account; here that needs
# root, and it is not a preference.  Measured 12 Sep 2026 as `don`, an
# ADMINISTRATOR, in a plain `sd` session: `CREATE.ACCOUNT` and `DELETE.ACCOUNT`
# both answer ***2001 "Command requires administrator privileges"*** and do
# nothing.  ***THAT REFUSAL IS NOT A VOC MISS*** - `CT VOC CREATE.ACCOUNT`
# returns `V / CA / $CREATEA`, so the verb resolved, ran, and stopped at
# CREATEA's own check; the control is that an invented verb answers
# "is not in your VOC" instead.  Section 4 is that measurement, and it is one
# of the few decisive things this side of the line can say about the verbs.
#
# ***THE CREATE-AND-DELETE HALF BELONGS IN AN OWNER-RUN WITNESS SCRIPT***, per
# the model PORT_ADOPTION 12 and 14 used: one script, backs up what it changes,
# PASS/FAIL on the success wording, restores on failure, tees to a log.  It
# also wants the FULL delete->install this project already owes, because a
# keep-accounts cycle never runs `installsdai.sh`'s seeding block.
#
# ***WHAT THIS HALF CAN STILL DECIDE, AND IT IS MORE THAN IT LOOKS.***  The
# register `@SDSYS/ACCOUNTS` is a DIRECTORY file and world-readable
# (`-rw-r--r-- root root`), so every claim it makes about the operating system
# can be checked against the operating system by an ordinary user, with no
# session at all.  Three of those checks are invariants nothing else enforces:
#
#   1. ***BOTH DIRECTIONS.***  `gplbld/reconcile-accounts.sh` (queue 19) finds
#      a register record whose Linux user has GONE.  Nothing looks the other
#      way - an account DIRECTORY with no register record - and that is the
#      direction a keep-accounts delete->install could produce, since the
#      directories survive the cycle and the register is rewritten by it.
#   2. ***FIELD 4 IS NEVER WRITTEN.***  `SYSCOM/KEYS.H` says so in a comment:
#      the retired `ACC$USERS` slot must stay empty, because "a new meaning
#      there would read old data as new".  A comment cannot enforce itself;
#      row R4 can.  18 Sep 26, the teardown: field 5 is the suspension flag
#      (blank or SUSPENDED) and field 6 is the retired prior-tier slot, both
#      enforced below in the same way.
#   3. ***THE LEGACY GROUPS ARE GONE.***  The teardown removed sdadmin and
#      sdapi; an install or upgrade that somehow recreated them would be
#      carrying the old model's machinery, and U5 says so.
#
# RUN IT UNELEVATED, AND THAT IS NOT A PREFERENCE EITHER.  Section 4 asks what
# a NON-ROOT session is refused; from a root shell every row in it would pass
# for the wrong reason, because `sudo sd` is exactly the session the verbs are
# meant to allow.
