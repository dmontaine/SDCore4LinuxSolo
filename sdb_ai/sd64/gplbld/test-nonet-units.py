# test-nonet-units.py - strip_c_comments, the one piece of verify-nonet.py with
#                       real logic, driven through the case that already caught
#                       it out once.  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22.

#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-nonet-units.py
#
# No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 all cases passed, 1 a case failed.
#
# ***WHY THIS EXISTS: verify-nonet.py FAILED ITS OWN FIRST RUN, ON PROSE.***
# Measured 12 Sep 2026 - 4 decisive rows red, every one of them a comment.
# `op_dio1.c`'s START-HISTORY says, in words, *"the ';' network-file dispatch
# and net_open() call are gone"* and *"gplsrc/netfiles.c and the NET_FILE type
# are deleted"*.  A search for `net_open(` found the sentence ANNOUNCING the
# removal and reported the removal as incomplete.
#
# ***THAT IS NOT A ONE-OFF, IT IS THE SHAPE OF THE PROBLEM.***  A removal check
# reads a codebase in which the removal is most likely to be DESCRIBED - in a
# history block, right at the top of the file it was removed from.  So the
# corpse and the tombstone sit in the same file, and any check that reads prose
# finds the tombstone first.  The real text is case 1 below, kept verbatim.
#
# ***AND THE RED DIRECTION IS THE DANGEROUS ONE HERE, WHICH IS UNUSUAL.***
# Elsewhere in this project a false "stale" is cheap and a false "current" is
# expensive.  Here it is the other way round: the false positive cost one
# debugging pass, but a strip_c_comments that blanked too much - a "*/" inside
# a string literal, say - would hide REAL code from the search and report a
# live net_open() as removed.  Cases 6 and 7 are that direction.
