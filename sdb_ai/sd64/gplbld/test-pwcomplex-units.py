"""Unit test for SD's password rule, SD Core for Linux.  Free - no install,
no sudo, no sd.

Written 19 Sep 2026, on the SD Core for Windows agent's mail of 14:30 the same
day.  It took this tree's `pw_complex` case block verbatim and asked for two
rows back: one proving an arm-order mutation is not vacuous, and one showing
the OLD shape accepting the TAB row the new one refuses.  Both are here (B2,
B3, S2, S3), and the port has the equivalent as `test-pwcomplex-units`.

WHAT IT IS FOR.  The owner's ruling of 19 Sep 2026 is that SD requires a
complex password whatever the operating system allows: 8+ characters with a
lower-case letter, an upper-case letter, a digit and a symbol (any other
printable ASCII, space included); a byte outside 32-126 fails outright.  ONE
RULE, WRITTEN TWICE IN THIS TREE, and they cannot be merged: `gpl.bp/pw_complex`
serves everything inside SD, and `gplbld/sd-elevate`'s `pw_complex` serves the
installer's sdsys prompt, which runs before SD can be reached at all.  A third
copy is the Windows port's.  So the table below is the rule's SPEC and both
implementations are driven through it.

THE BASIC IS CHECKED WITHOUT BEING RUN, AND THE LIMIT IS STATED RATHER THAN
GLOSSED.  Nothing in a session can execute SD BASIC - a GPL.BP change is proven
by commit, push and reinstall.  So this reads the RANGES and the ARM ORDER out
of `gpl.bp/pw_complex` and drives the table through what the file says.  That
is weaker than running it: it proves the rule the file states, not the rule the
compiler emits.  The compiled behaviour is witnessed on an install
(`witness-absence.sh` M2e/f, M11a-d).

WHY THE ARM ORDER IS WORTH A TEST AT ALL.  The port's first shape tested
out-of-range in the FIRST arm and let the catch-all mean "symbol".  That is
correct only while nobody reorders the arms: move it and a byte outside 32-126
falls through to the catch-all and SATISFIES the symbol requirement it exists
to fail - it fails OPEN.  This tree's shape names 32-126 in the symbol arm and
returns false from the catch-all, so an unmatched byte is refused whatever the
order.  B2 drives EVERY permutation of the arms and requires the non-printable
rows to be refused by all of them; B3 shows the old shape accepting the tab row
once its guard arm is no longer first.  Mutants run on text.  THE LIVE FILES
ARE ASSERTED BYTE-IDENTICAL AFTERWARDS.

Null case refused out loud: a run with no ALLOW rows, no REFUSE rows, no
permutations, or a mutant that stayed green, exits 2 rather than reporting
success.

  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-pwcomplex-units.py

No sudo.  Exit 0 all rows passed, 1 a row failed, 2 a premise was not found in
the source or the run established nothing.
