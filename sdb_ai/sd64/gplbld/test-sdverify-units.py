# test-sdverify-units.py - drive every arm of sdverify.py, INCLUDING THE ARMS
#                          THAT MUST FAIL.  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-sdverify-units.py
#
# No sudo.  No install.  It never runs the real sd.  Exit 0 all cases passed,
# 1 a case failed.
#
# WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM sdverify.py --selftest.  The selftest covers the PURE
# half - text matching and the verdict - and a verifier can call it in one line
# to assert its own harness is sane.  This file covers THE DRIVER, which is the
# half that can lie: run_sd can return empty text on a hang, swallow the
# session body, or hand back sd's escape sequences, and every one of those
# turns into a check that passes having measured nothing.
#
# HOW THE DRIVER IS TESTED WITHOUT AN INSTALL.  Each case writes a THROWAWAY
# SHELL SCRIPT that stands in for sd - one that echoes the stdin it was given,
# one that emits ANSI and BEL, one that sleeps past the timeout - so the arm
# under test is the driver's handling of what a real sd could do, measured
# rather than argued.  A real-sd case would need a current install and would
# test sd, not this file.
#
# ***THE LOAD-BEARING CASES ARE THE RED ONES.***  "The driver reports a timeout
# as a timeout" and "a run with no decisive row FAILS" are the two properties
# that separate this harness from a block of code that always says PASS; a
# green suite that omits them proves nothing about either.
