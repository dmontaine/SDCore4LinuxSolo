# verify-txn.py - does COMMIT end the transaction it commits, does a NESTED
#                 commit keep the outer transaction's writes, and does a
#                 directory file's record id get MAPPED inside a transaction?
#                 PORT_ADOPTION queue 22; intent from the port's verify-txn.ps1.

#   python3 .../verify-txn.py --allow-stale       measure a stale install
#
# NO SUDO.  Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a decisive check failed,
# 2 the test could not be run.
#
# ***WHY IT EXISTS, IN THE PORT'S WORDS: PART OF A TRANSACTION LANDING AND PART
# NOT IS THE ONE OUTCOME A TRANSACTION EXISTS TO PREVENT, AND NOTHING REPORTED
# IT*** - not an error, not a status, not a log line.  A silent data-loss
# regression is exactly the kind that comes back unnoticed, so it belongs in a
# standing suite rather than in a probe somebody remembers to run.
#
# THREE QUESTIONS, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS TWO INSTRUMENTS.
#
#   1. SYSTEM(1008) after COMMIT.  op_txnbgn() incremented the level and
#      op_txncmt() decremented nothing, so the level climbed for ever and a
#      program could not ask "am I in a transaction".  Row T3 is the check;
#      T1 and T2 are what stop T3 being a zero that was never anything else.
#   2. A nested commit must not orphan the OUTER transaction's cache.  Row T7
#      is the data-loss row: S2 is written by the outer transaction BEFORE the
#      inner one runs, so it is exactly the write that went missing.
#   3. A directory file's record id becomes a FILENAME and is mapped -
#      "*,=><%/+:;?\\\"" -> "ACEGLPSVXYZBQ" (sd.h:113-114), so "," is "%C".
#      op_txncmt() handed the RAW id to dir_write() and to the delete path, so
#      a WRITE inside a transaction created a file the matching READ could
#      never find, and a DELETE removed a path that had never existed,
#      tolerated the ENOENT and reported success.
#
# ***SECTION 3 NEEDS BOTH INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE EITHER ALONE CAN BE SATISFIED BY
# THE WRONG THING.***  What SD reads back and what is actually on disk have to
# agree: a raw-id write followed by a raw-id read would satisfy SD, and a file
# of the right name with the wrong content would satisfy the directory listing.
# Rows D1-D3 are SD's answer; rows E1-E6 are the filesystem's.
#
# ***AND ON LINUX THE WHOLE CLASS IS SILENT, WHICH IS WORSE THAN IN THE PORT.***
# The port chose ids that are legal Windows filenames in BOTH forms so that the
# failure would be silent rather than loud - ">" and "*" are illegal there and
# would have failed noisily, proving nothing about the silent case.  Here every
# one of the thirteen characters is a legal Linux filename character, so an
# unmapped write ALWAYS succeeds under the wrong name.  Rows E4-E6 are what
# catch that: they assert the RAW-id files are absent, which is the only sign
# an unmapped write leaves on this platform.
#
# RUN IT UNELEVATED, and that is not a preference.  The probe is compiled and
# run in the CALLER'S OWN account; a root session lands in SDSYS instead, where
# the probe is not, so it would measure the wrong account or nothing at all.
#
# NOT INSTALLED AND NOT SHIPPED.  verify-txn.bp lives next to this file and is
# staged into the account's BP only for the run.
