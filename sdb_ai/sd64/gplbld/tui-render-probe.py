# tui-render-probe.py - S.1 stage 1, the measurement the design note puts FIRST:
#                       can a double-buffered, minimal-diff renderer written in
#                       SD BASIC redraw 160x48 fast enough to be interactive?
#                       Also: does an xterm SGR mouse report reach KEYIN intact?
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/tui-render-probe.py --sandbox <dir>
#
# The <dir> is a sandbox built by sandbox-txnfail.py --keep and STARTED
# (SD_CONFIG=<dir>/sd.conf <dir>/sys/bin/sd -start, its sdlnxd killed).
# No sudo, never the live system.  Exit 0 measured, 2 could not run.  It gives
# NUMBERS, not a verdict: the threshold is stated beside them and the decision
# is written into PROJECT_STATUS, where it can be argued with.
#
# WHAT IT RUNS AND HOW IT READS IT
#   sd runs inside a pty (TERM=xterm-256color, 200x60), so SD's terminal code
#   takes the same path it takes for a person, and this reads the pty as fast
#   as the bytes come - a sink that never slows the writer, so what is timed is
#   SD, not an emulator.  The probe program prints its own CPU milliseconds per
#   workload after leaving the alternate screen; this adds the WALL time
#   between markers and the byte count that actually arrived.
#
#   MOUSE: after the renderer, a second program KEYINs for 3 s while this writes
#   "ESC [ < 0 ; 12 ; 5 M" (an xterm 1006 button-press report) into the pty; the
#   program prints every byte it received as decimal codes.  The report is
#   intact when those codes are exactly 27 91 60 48 59 49 50 59 53 77.
