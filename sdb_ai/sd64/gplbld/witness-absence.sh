#
# WHAT IT PROVES ABSENT
#   M1  no tier policy: /usr/local/sdsys/tier.policy is not there, and the
#       TIERGATE program is not in sdsys's VOC (S.25).
#   M2  a fresh CREATE.ACCOUNT writes no tier: field 5 of the new record is
#       blank (the suspension flag) and field 6 is blank (S.25/W.7).
#   M3  no tier keyword in MODIFY.ACCOUNT's grammar: the tier words are
#       refused as unexpected tokens, and SUSPENDED/UNSUSPENDED are the flag
#       (S.25/W.7).
#   M4  no OS-access grants: SH-ON/SH-OFF/OS-ON/OS-OFF are refused by
#       MODIFY.ACCOUNT, and fields 7/8 are gone from the register (S.27).
#   M5  no API route words: API/NONE/SSH/BOTH are refused by
#       MODIFY.ACCOUNT and CREATE.ACCOUNT (S.28).
#   M6  no grant verbs: GRANT/REVOKE/LIST.GRANTS are refused as not in VOC
#       (W.8); a grant is usermod -aG.
#   M7  no sdadmin or sdapi group exists (S.26/S.28); the sudoers drop-in
#       names the sdsys user alone; the ssh boundary block forces every
#       sdusers member into sd and denies sdsys network login (S.28).
#   M8  the administrator model, driven: a root session is refused outright
#       (10190, audited) and a local sdsys session is granted (10916).
#   M9  the machine-side absences the source must not contradict: this
#       script checks the shipped installer, deleter, ssh helper, sudoers
#       and register-key comments in the source tree it lives in.
#   M14 English only (S.46, 29 Sep 2026): SETLANG/LOADLANG, their
#       catalog entries and their messages are not installed; NLS (kept,
#       owner 29 Sep) is, and runs for a plain account; and DATE
#       prints English day and month names for a plain account.
#
# THE THROWAWAY.  M2 needs a real CREATE.ACCOUNT, so a throwaway account
# (zzabst) is made as sdsys - SD's whole flow, Linux user and all - and
# DELETE.ACCOUNTed afterwards whatever happens.  Its Linux password is
# generated per run and printed nowhere.
#
# Exit 0 every check passed, 1 a check failed (or was not reached), 2 it could
# not run.

#   supplies the user, so run_sd_as consumed the caller's extra "sdsys" as the
#   TITLE and the intended title fell through into the command list.  Sixteen
#   sites did it; three (M2, M11) used the right form all along, which is why
#   only some session headers read "as sdsys: sdsys".
#
#   ***WHAT IT COST, AND IT IS NOT NOTHING.***  Each of those sessions ran its
#   verb TWICE - the title, then the command - so M5a's "has no remote access"
#   came from the TITLE's execution and the command that the row names answered
#   "already had that access".  Every row still passed and the machine-state
#   rows (M5a2 etc., read from id -nG) were never in doubt, but a row whose

#   positive waiting for a verb that is not idempotent.  M5g's stray
#   "Unexpected token ((" was the same fault, visible.
#
#   THE FIX IS THE CONVENTION, NOT THE SIXTEEN CALLS: run_sd's first argument
#   is now the TITLE, as its three correct callers always assumed, and the

#   uses run_sd_as, which is what it is for.

# 29 Sep 26 dm - M14, S.46: English only (owner, 29 Sep 2026).  The removal
#   of SETLANG/LOADLANG, their messages and K$SET.LANGUAGE, seen on the
#   install.  The file rows run in a dry run too; an install that predates
#   the removal FAILS M14a-c (measured 29 Sep on the 22 Sep install, dry
#   run: all thirteen FAIL, M14c2 passes, when NLS was still listed), which
#   shows they reach the machine.  M14d is the
#   runtime half of load_language's replacement, init_messages(): DATE prints
#   the day and month names from the tables it builds, as a plain account.
#   Anchored on the full expected date, never on the echoed ":DATE".
#   Later the same day the owner kept NLS ("restore nls"): it sets currency
#   and separators, not a language.  M14a-c no longer list it; M14e is the
#   other direction - installed, catalogued, in a fresh account's VOC (the
#   throwaway is made from NEWVOC) and printing its own message 6900.
