# sdverify.py - the shared half of every verify-*.py in this directory.
#               PORT_ADOPTION queue 22 ("verifier intent").
#
#   import sdverify as V                       # it is a module, not a script
#   python3 gplbld/sdverify.py --selftest      # the pure half, no sd, no files
#
# Exit codes every verifier built on this module uses, and they are the port's:
#   0  every decisive check passed
#   1  a decisive check failed
#   2  the test could not be run  (a precondition, not a verdict)
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, AND IT IS THE WHOLE OF QUEUE 22'S FIRST STEP.
# SD Core for Windows has 51 verify-*.ps1 and 28 test-*-units.ps1.  Each
# verifier carries its OWN copy of the result table, the verdict line, the two
# text helpers and the sd driver, and the port needs test-verdict-units.ps1 to
# assert that the verdict line has stayed byte-for-byte identical across four
# of those copies.  That is a check on a smell.  Here the block is imported, so
# the drift it polices cannot happen, and test-sdverify-units.py tests ONE
# implementation instead of asserting that N copies still agree.
#
# WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE PORT UNCHANGED (intent, not code):
#   * Note/verdict with a DECISIVE flag, so a run of only informational rows
#     cannot report success.
#   * "NO DECISIVE CHECK RAN" is a FAILURE, not a pass.  CLAUDE.md: a test that
#     passes because it did nothing must fail.
#   * The text helpers are PURE and take a REGULAR EXPRESSION, never a bare
#     string.  They print nothing: a function that both prints and returns
#     hands the caller its own narration joined to the tool's output, and a
#     check on "the output" then quietly becomes a check on the narration.
#   * MATCHING IS CASE-SENSITIVE.  Several fixes here ARE case behaviour, so a
#     case-insensitive match would let a disqualifier match its own success
#     wording and fail a working build.
#   * The raw session output is printed unconditionally.  A conditional print
#     cannot show a subtle refusal, because the condition is the thing that was
#     wrong.
#   * The commands are echoed from the LIST THAT WAS PASSED, not from sd's echo
#     of them: the port has a transcript in which sd's own erase-line sequences
#     rendered a command that executed correctly as a different command.
#
# WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE, AND EACH DIFFERENCE IS A MEASUREMENT SOMEBODY PAID
# FOR (PROJECT_STATUS "START HERE", 11 Sep 2026):
#   1. EVERY SESSION ENDS IN "OFF" AND build_session() REFUSES TO BUILD ONE
#      THAT DOES NOT.  On an install older than c2b375d the ":" prompt
#      busy-loops at end of input - 369 207 BEL bytes in 10 s, exit 124.  The
#      fix is installed, but an instrument that only works on a current install
#      is the wrong shape for a project whose installs go stale.
#   2. A TIMEOUT IS NOT OPTIONAL AND A TIMED-OUT RUN IS FATAL, NOT EMPTY.  Any
#      verb that prompts eats the next line down a pipe, OFF included.
#   3. NAME EVERY OPTIONAL ARGUMENT.  A verb whose argument is optional prompts
#      for it, and the prompt swallows the following line.  The tell is a
#      transcript whose last line is a prompt and where the next command never
#      appears.
#   4. IT REFUSES TO RUN AS ROOT unless the caller says root is what is being
#      measured.  CLAUDE.md, hand-over rule 3: some measurements here are only
#      valid as an ordinary user, so the wrong shell does not merely fail - it
#      produces a clean-looking wrong answer.
#   5. The account is the CALLER'S OWN, not SDSYS.  The port runs elevated
#      because its fixtures live in SDSYS; on Linux the same fixtures live in
#      /home/sd/user_accounts/<user>, so a verifier built on this module needs
#      no sudo - which is what makes it runnable at all, since the agent
#      maintaining this system cannot sudo.
