"""test-vocnames-units.py - the shipped VOC records and BASIC programs name things in lower case.

WHY (PAL-1 stage 3a/3b, 7 Oct 2026).  Program, call and catalogue names are lower case in SD (stage 3a), and
the owner's standard is that nothing SD ships spells a name two ways.  Two kinds of shipped text still could:

  1. the VOC record of a verb (sdsys/newvoc, sdsys/voc_template): line 3 of a CA record names the
     catalogued program that runs it.  It was $ALIAS; it is $alias.
  2. a $include line in an SD BASIC program (sdsys/gpl.bp): it was `$include KEYS.H`; it is `keys.h`, the
     name of the file on disk.  On ext4 the other spelling is only found through the program's own fold.

It reads files; no SD, no install, no sudo.  The control is a copy of a record with a capital planted, which
this check must refuse.  Exit 0 all rows passed, 1 a row failed, 2 it could not run.
