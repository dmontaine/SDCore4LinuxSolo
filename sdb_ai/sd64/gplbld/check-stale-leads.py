"""Find entries whose OPENING status claim is contradicted LATER IN THE SAME ENTRY.

    python3 gplbld/check-stale-leads.py              the three tracked documents
    python3 gplbld/check-stale-leads.py FILE...      named files instead

Exit 0 nothing to read, 1 there is a worklist, 2 the question could not be
answered (a document missing, no entries found in one, or no task table -
which means the shapes below have drifted and every "clean" verdict would be
worthless).  Phase 2 needs all three documents, so FILE... must name them.

TWO PHASES.  Phase 1 finds an entry whose opening status claim is
contradicted later in the same entry.  Phase 2 (end of file, 14 Sep 2026)
checks the task table at the top of PROJECT_STATUS.md against the entries in
both directions; it arrived with the table, adopted from the port.

PORT_ADOPTION 21.  ***THIS IS NOT THE PORT'S SCRIPT AND COULD NOT BE.***  Its
check-stale-leads.py is keyed to the port's PROJECT_STATUS - a section 7,
"> ###" START HERE items, a check-mark task table - and PRE_RELEASE 9 records
what happened when it was copied here verbatim: it exited 2 before any phase
ran, "REFUSING - could not bound section 7", and was removed rather than
committed, because a tool that always exits 2 reads like a guard the project
has.  This is written to the shapes THIS tree actually uses.

THE FAULT IT LOOKS FOR.  A reader - human or agent - reads top-down and stops
at the first status sentence.  When a correction is APPENDED to an entry rather
than the opening being struck, the entry lies to everyone who does not read all
of it.  The entries here run to thousands of characters, so that is most
readers most of the time.

***IT FOUND ONE THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN, AND THE SESSION THAT WROTE IT HAD MADE
IT AN HOUR EARLIER.***  PORT_ADOPTION queue 19 opened "THE SWEEP IS BUILT AND
NOT WIRED, PENDING A RULING" and, 2000 characters later in the same row, said
"RULED BY THE OWNER, 12 Sep 2026: SWEEP, full port parity".  Both sentences
were written by the same session on the same day; the second was appended when
the ruling came in and the first was left standing.

WHAT IT IS NOT.  ***This does not decide staleness; it RANKS entries for
reading.***  An entry may legitimately narrate "this was open, then it closed" -
several here do it deliberately, because CLAUDE.md asks that a resolved
objection stay in the entry.  The output is a worklist and every hit is read by
hand.  Saying so matters: a script that reported these as defects would be
committing the same overconfidence it exists to catch.

WHY NOT THE PORT'S OTHER PHASES.  Until 14 Sep 2026 this had only phase 1,
because phase 2 needs a task table and this tree had none; the table now
exists, and so does phase 2.  The port's phase 3 needs judgements a
word-matcher cannot make.  ***A tool that does what it says is worth more here
than phases that half-run*** - which is PRE_RELEASE 9's lesson, paid for by the
copy that would not start.

THE LIMIT, WORTH KNOWING BEFORE TRUSTING ANY OF IT: this compares a document
against ITSELF.  It cannot tell that an entry agrees with itself and is wrong
about the machine.  Only a measurement does that.
