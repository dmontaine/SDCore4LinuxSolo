# witness-release-run.sh - three witnesses that need a throwaway account, in
#                          one owner-run pass on one install:
#     S.9   LOGIN's $release prompt (5026) takes N on Enter and at end of input
#     Q.28  RUN of a runfile path over 128 characters runs (S.48; 10918 is for 255)
#     S.2   the administrator (sdsys) LOGTOs an account whose group is newer
#           than the session (2)
#     Q.22  logtoaccess: the administrator keeps its access across LOGTOs (2b)
#     S.10  RUN folds the program name (3b)
#     W.2   Enter at 2050 means N; W.3  6133 cancels on Enter or C (5b)
#     S.4   struck (OS.EXECUTE runs at the account's own Linux permissions)
#     S.3   struck (one VOC layer: NEWVOC as shipped for every account)
#     Q.13  MODIFY.ACCOUNT ADD/DELETE and ELEVATION REFUSED reach the audit
#           trail (8); a second throwaway, zzrel2, is made and removed
#     S.12  struck (the GRANT verb is gone; a grant is Linux group membership)
#     S.6   struck (SH runs at the account's own Linux permissions)
#     S.5   the 10 Sep parity audit's witness list (12, 15); a third throwaway,
#           zzrel3, carries SD's "SD account" stamp and is deleted by SD
#     Q.17  MODIFY.PASSWORD's administrator arm, checked in /etc/shadow (13)
#     W.4   the API door over TCP 4243 (13b): login, the session's groups, a
#           wrong password and its audit record; the SCRAM login, requests
#           47/48, against $cred (13c)
#     Q.12  ssh AND the API into a SUSPENDED account are refused, after a
#           control (14); a throwaway ssh key is installed for zzrel1 only
#     S.29  the ssh half, on the same real ssh login: the route withdrawn
#           (the API kept), refused 10074, given back, admitted (14, X7-X9b)
#     S.17  SDSYS is refused over the API from a non-loopback address and
#           admitted locally (13e)
#     S.29  the per-account API route, narrowed and re-widened over a real
#           SCRAM login: admitted, NONE, refused 10073, BOTH, admitted (13f)
#     S.13  REMOTE.API LOCAL / OFF / ON and REMOTE.SSH OFF / ON, a session
#           surviving the socket restart; the machine's prior listener and
#           firewall state is saved and put back (13h)
#     Q.22  sdsyswrite: from a sdsys session that started in zzrel1 and
#           LOGTOed SDSYS, the register and $cred writes land on disk; a
#           plain session is refused and changes nothing (13g)
#     S.19  every API connection is TLS 1.3 with the login bound to it: TCP and
#           the Unix socket, no plaintext ACK, 'n,,' refused, the identity
#           root 0600, the relay runs as nobody, and a recording proxy sees no
#           marker and no user name on the wire (13i)
#     S.18  the dead login code is gone: SCRAM and request 24 over the Unix
#           socket (13c S8), sd links no libcrypt/libbsd, CONFIG has no
#           APILOGIN, a restored sd.conf still carrying it starts (16)
#     ALSO TOUCHES REAL STATE: section 12 runs UPDATE.ACCOUNTS ALL, which
#     updates every account's VOC as each install does.
#
#   18 Sep 26, THE TEARDOWN: every privileged step now runs as SDSYS - a local
#   session running as the sdsys OS user, the one administrator.  A root
#   session is refused outright and is measured as such (section 8's T4,
#   13b's A4.0).  witness-absence.sh carries the absence half of the model.
#
#   bash      /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/witness-release-run.sh
#   sudo bash /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/witness-release-run.sh --commit
#
# ***NEEDS sudo, ONLY FOR --commit.***  The dry run changes nothing.
# Exit 0 every check passed, 1 a check failed (or was not reached), 2 it could
# not run.  The log goes to /var/tmp, which survives a reboot (the 14 Sep
# witness-tierchange log in /tmp did not).
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE THROWAWAY, AND WHY NOT don
# ===========================================================================
# don is the owner's login and never a fixture.  This makes Linux user zzrel1,
# CREATEd the way SD creates every account (CREATE.ACCOUNT as sdsys, no
# password
# prompt), and removes both at the end, whatever happened.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT EACH PART MEASURES
# ===========================================================================
# S.2  This script's own process started BEFORE sdu_zzrel1 existed, so its
#      supplementary groups lack it - exactly the stale case.  Every root sd it
#      starts inherits that list, and the S.2 fix (sdext_eguid.c, initgroups
#      before the euid drop) must refresh it.  The script PRINTS its own group
#      list and the new group's gid, and if the group is somehow already in the
#      list the S.2 rows are NOT REACHED rather than passed.
#
# S.9  As zzrel1: BASIC compiles two tiny programs from bp (a directory file, so
#      the source is written straight to disk).  ZZREL sets $release field 2 to
#      L0.9-9; ZZSHOW prints it.  Then three sign-ons:
#        (a) a blank first line - that line is the prompt's answer.  Enter must
#            mean N: the session goes on to WHO, and "Please answer Y or N"
#            (5027) never appears.  Before the fix a blank re-asked, and the next
#            line (TERM) re-asked again.
#        (b) </dev/null - end of input at the prompt.  Must finish, not spin.
#        (c) RUN BP ZZSHOW - field 2 must STILL be L0.9-9, so N changed nothing.
#      Success wording: the NEW prompt text "(y/<n>)?", so a run against an
#      install without the message change fails rather than passing on 5025.
#
# Q.28 As zzrel1: ZZSHOW's object copied into a DEEP directory, reached through
#      a VOC F-pointer zzdeep.out written by a third program (ZZVOC), so that
#      the run path exceeds 128 characters with a short record name, then RUN
#      ZZDEEP zzshow.  ***29 Sep 26, S.48: THE LIMIT IS NOW 255, SO THE RUN
#      MUST SUCCEED*** - Q1 wants zzshow's own output and no 10918.  Before
#      that it had to print 10918's words; "Invalid runfile pathname"
#      (1135, the old message), "Message not found" (10918 not installed) or
#      "not found" (the lookup never reached the length check) fail it.
#      ***NOT A LONG RECORD NAME, AND THE 13:07 RUN SHOWED WHY:*** MAXIDLEN
#      defaults to 63 (config.c:139) and valid_id (op_dio3.c) rejects a longer
#      id, so a 100-character name answered "Program ... not found" before RUN
#      ever measured the path.  With a 63-character id, a 32-character account
#      name and /home/sd/user_accounts, a bp.out path tops out at 126 - so the
#      limit is only reachable through a deeper data file, as here.
#
# THE PIPED-SESSION RULES ARE THE PROJECT'S: a blank first line, TERM 200,9999,
# every session ends in OFF, every sd has a timeout.

# The writers exist (modifya ADD/DELETE; cproc ELEVATION REFUSED), so each is
# driven once and the NEW lines of the trail are read - by line count, before
# and after, so an old record cannot pass.  Under the teardown the refused
# elevation is a root session refused outright (10190), and the granted one

# W.4 SCRAM phase 3 - REQUESTS 47 AND 48, THE PORT'S SCRAM LOGIN, through
# gplbld/scram-probe.py (the exchange in Python's standard library, no SD code
# on the client side).  zzrel1 now has TWO passwords that differ: the SD one
# in $cred (SCRAM_PW, long since 13b's A5) and the Linux one set by chpasswd
# in section 13 (LINUX_PW).  That difference is the instrument:
#   S1 CONTROL: SCRAM with the SD password logs in, the server's signature
#      verifies, the account is entered and WHO names zzrel1.
#   S2 the SCRAM session's own /proc: the uid is zzrel1's and it holds sdusers
#      and sdu_zzrel1, none of them root's (K$ASSUME.USER, op_kernel.c).
#   S3 a wrong password is refused at 48 in 5017's words, audited "wrong password".
#   S4 THE ROW: SCRAM with the LINUX password is refused - it checks $cred, not
#      /etc/shadow ...
#   S5 ... and the old request 24 with the SD password is refused - it still
#      checks /etc/shadow until phase 5 - while S5c, request 24 with the Linux
#      password, is ACCEPTED.  Since phase 4 the client library cannot send 24,
#      so both go through scram-probe --legacy.  S1 with S4, S5 and S5c is what
#      shows each door reads its own credential.
#   S6 request 48 with no 47 is a sequence error (5273), audited.
#   S7 an unknown user is refused at 47 in 5017's words, audited "no credential".
#   S8 S.18: S1 again over the UNIX SOCKET (scram-probe --unix), whose server
#      side lost its getpeereid() peer capture, and S8d request 24 over it is
#      refused in 5275's words - that socket is where APILOGIN=0 once let a
#      peer in with no password.  The path is read from the installed unit.

# S.19 - EVERY API CONNECTION IS TLS 1.3, AND THE LOGIN IS BOUND TO IT.
# Placed before 13h, which changes the listener and ends by clearing the SD
# password.  scram-probe drives libssl itself (Python's ssl module cannot
# export the binding), so every sprobe call in this run already goes over TLS;
# this section adds the rows that would pass if the transport were NOT secure.
#   T1 CONTROL: a bound login over TCP runs WHO, and the probe names the TLS
#      version it negotiated.
#   T2 the same over the Unix socket (USOCK, read from the unit in 13c).
#   T3 a client WITHOUT TLS gets no ACK: the server said nothing in plaintext.
#   T4 the downgrade: the unbound 'n,,' header inside TLS is refused at 47.
#   T5 the identity: /etc/sd-tls root 700 and api.pem root 600, made by the
#      first connection at the latest.
#   T6 the relay is not root: during a held session, the session's sd process
#      has an sd child owned by nobody.  Null guard: the session is found first.
#   T7 THE OWNER'S FALSIFIER, without tcpdump: a recording proxy between the
#      probe and 127.0.0.1:4243 keeps every byte both ways while the session
#      DISPLAYs a marker.  The marker must reach the probe (control) and must
#      not be in the recording, nor the user name; under 1 KB measured nothing.
#   T8 the installed sd links libssl.
#   T9-T13 (15 Sep 2026, adopted from the Windows port's verify-scramlogin, its
#      RELEASE_1.1 42): each message is wrong in EXACTLY ONE WAY, so the
#      refusal names which server check fired.  Refused at 48 in 5272's words:
#        T9  a captured client-final replayed on a new connection (c= rewritten
#            to that connection's binding, so only the nonce is stale)
#        T10 a tampered nonce
#        T11 c= carrying the binding with one bit flipped - a login relayed by
#            a man in the middle
#      Refused at 47 in 5272's words:
#        T12 the 'y,,' downgrade header
#        T13 an m= mandatory extension
#   T14 the wire line: the password is absent from every plaintext byte a
#      bound login handed to TLS.  T14b/c CONTROL: --legacy's request 24 carries
#      the password, is refused, and the same search FINDS it.

# S.18 - WHAT THE DEAD LOGIN CODE LEFT BEHIND, read off the install.  No
# throwaway needed.
#   R1 the installed sd links no libcrypt and no libbsd (crypt() and
#      getpeereid() went with login_user); libsodium must be listed, or the
#      ldd read nothing and the absences mean nothing.
#   R2 CONFIG reports no APILOGIN line, against CMDSTACK which it must.
#   R3 THE TRAP: an unrecognised sd.conf key is FATAL (config.c), and a keep
#      cycle restores an sd.conf written while APILOGIN=1 shipped.  If the
#      live /etc/sd.conf still carries it, sd.service being active is the
#      proof it is accepted.  A full cycle ships sd.conf without it, and then
#      R3 is NOT REACHED - it did not measure the claim, so it does not pass.
#
#      ***R3 IS MEASURABLE ONLY ON A KEEP-CONFIGURATION CYCLE, AND THAT IS A
#      PRECONDITION OF THE ROW, NOT A FAULT IN IT.***  Answer Y to "keep your
#      existing configuration" and R3 measures the claim; answer N and it
#      cannot, because a fresh sd.conf has no APILOGIN line to accept.
#
#      A CHEAPER ROUTE WAS LOOKED FOR ON 15 Sep 2026 AND DOES NOT EXIST, so
#      do not spend the session finding that out again.  read_config() is
#      called from ONE place, sysseg.c:139, and only when the shared segment
#      is being CREATED - so a session started against a private config named
#      by SD_CONFIG never parses it at all (measured: the built sd with
#      SD_CONFIG pointing at an absent file started normally and reached the
#      : prompt).  Starting a second system to force the parse is not open
#      either: the segment key is the fixed SD_SHM_KEY (sysseg.c:306), so
#      `sd -start` finds the live segment and returns before reading any
#      config.  Forcing the condition therefore means stopping the live
#      system, which a witness run must not do to the box it is measuring.
