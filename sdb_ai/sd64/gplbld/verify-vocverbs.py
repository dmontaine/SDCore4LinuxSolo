#
# NO SUDO, and that is a Linux divergence from the port worth stating.  SD Core
# for Windows runs its verify-vocverbs.ps1 ELEVATED because every session there
# starts with LOGTO SDSYS and the fixtures live in the SDSYS account directory.
# Here the same fixtures live in the caller's OWN account under
# /home/sd/user_accounts/<user>, so this runs as an ordinary user - which is
# also the only way it can run at all, since the agent maintaining this system
# cannot sudo.  It REFUSES a root shell: a root session answers a different
# question and answers it cleanly.
#
# Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a decisive check failed, 2 the test
# could not be run.
#
# ***WHAT IT TOUCHES, AND IT IS ALL ITS OWN.***  Two file names and one VOC
# pointer, all under --prefix, all created and removed by this run.  The
# @SDSYS fixture is a COPY of the account's own SYSCOM pointer rather than a
# real system file, and the run asserts /usr/local/sdsys/syscom is still on
# disk afterwards - before and after, so "it was already gone" cannot pass.
#
# ***EVERY CHECK ANCHORS ON WORDING THE VERB PRINTS ONLY ON THE PATH UNDER
# TEST, AND NAMES A DISQUALIFIER.***  CLAUDE.md: a pattern shared by the
# success and failure outputs is not a check.
#
#   queue 1   3261 must end in a select list NUMBER.  The defect printed the
#             SAME message with one argument, so the text was identical up to a
#             dangling "select list ".  Matching "select list" would have
#             passed on the defect; the check is that a number follows it.
#   queue 3   10117's own sentence, which only check.sdsys.file's NO.QUERY
#             branch prints, AND the absence of 6146 (the prompt it replaced),
#             AND THE ABSENCE OF 6135.  The third of those was added 12 Sep
#             2026 because this file found the defect it catches, and it is the
#             row the port's own verifier does not have - see below.
#   queue 3b  6136/6141/6144 present and 6135/6140 ABSENT, for a file whose
#             name was typed in lower case.  6135 is guarded by not(force), NOT
#             by no.query, so NO.QUERY does not suppress it: only the
#             case-insensitive path comparison keeps it quiet.  A test that
#             passed FORCE here could not fail.
#
# ***WHY ROW B4 EXISTS, AND IT IS THE WHOLE ARGUMENT FOR QUEUE 22.***  The
# port's verify-vocverbs.ps1 checks 10117 and the absence of 6146 on this
# fixture, and both were true here - while DELETE.FILE went on to print "OK to
# delete DATA portion '' (y/<n>)?" three times and eat the two commands that
# followed.  The VOC record still went and the system file was still left
# alone, so the OUTCOME was right and only the route was wrong.  A check on the
# outcome cannot see that; a check on the ABSENCE of the prompt can.  Measured
# 12 Sep 2026 on install 06d3a4a as don; cause and fix at DELETEF:229-246.
#
# ***MATCHING IS CASE-SENSITIVE.***  Two of the three fixes ARE case behaviour,
# so an insensitive match would let a disqualifier match its own success
# wording and report a broken build as a working one.
#
# ***ONE SESSION PER CHECK, AND THE SESSIONS ARE NOT COMBINED.***  A verb that
# prompts eats the line after it, so a combined session would lose the very
# command that reads the result back, and the transcript would show the check
# as "not found" rather than as the prompt it really was.  Reading the result
# back in a FRESH session also means the read cannot be eaten by the thing it
# is measuring.
