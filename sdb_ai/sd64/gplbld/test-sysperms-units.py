# test-sysperms-units.py - prove verify-sysperms.py's probes cannot damage what
#                          they measure.  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22, item 7.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-sysperms-units.py
#
# No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 all cases passed, 1 a case failed.
#
# ***THIS EXISTS FOR ONE PROPERTY, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT WOULD BE
# CATASTROPHIC RATHER THAN MERELY WRONG.***  verify-sysperms asks "can I write
# this?" by TRYING - that is the port's rule and the reason the mode bits are
# not trusted - and it asks it of `bin/sd`, `bin/pcode` and `bin/libsdcli.so`.
# A probe that answered correctly while truncating the interpreter would pass
# its own run and take the system down with it.  So file_writable() opens in
# APPEND mode and writes nothing, and cases 1-6 prove that leaves the content,
# the length AND the mtime untouched - on a file it CAN write, which is the
# only case where damage is possible at all.
#
# ***THE SECOND PROPERTY IS THAT A PROBE LEAVES NOTHING BEHIND.***  A stray
# .zzsysperms-probe in $IPC or prt would be litter in a live system directory,
# and in $IPC it sits beside the files every session reads.  Cases 7-10.
#
# The refusal paths are tested too (cases 11-13): a probe that returned False
# because of a BUG rather than a permission would report a locked system that
# is in fact wide open - the direction that fails quietly.
