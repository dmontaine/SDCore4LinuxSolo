# sandbox-runpath.py - S.48: RUN of a runfile path over 128 characters, RUN
#                      rather than compiled, in a private sandbox SD.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/sandbox-runpath.py --dir <empty scratch dir>
#   python3 .../sandbox-runpath.py --dir <dir> --keep      leave the sandbox built
#
# NO SUDO, AND NEVER THE LIVE SYSTEM.  Exit 0 every row passed on the new
# build AND the control refused as the old code must; 1 a row failed; 2 it
# could not run (or refused to).
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES
#   op_run() now takes a runfile path up to MAX_PATHNAME_LEN (255), and
#   load_object() keeps the tail of a name longer than the object header's
#   128 (SD Core Solo's SOLO 12).  A probe program is compiled, its object
#   copied into directories reached through VOC F-pointers, and RUN from:
#     R1  a 165-character path: the NEW build runs it (the probe's marker),
#         twice in one session - the second call goes through load_object's
#         cache with a truncated header name, which must reload, not misfire
#     R2  the same path on the CONTROL (the installed pre-change source):
#         refused with 10918 naming 128 - which is what shows R1 reached the
#         length check at all
#     R3  a path over 255: the NEW build refuses it cleanly and the session
#         carries on.  Measured: CPROC's readv of the record refuses first
#         ("Overflowed path/filename length in op_readv()!"), so 10918 is a
#         backstop RUN never reaches from CPROC; either wording passes.
# WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE
#   k_error's snprintf bound (the other half of S.48): an overrun needs a
#   message plus program name over 240 bytes and shows only as memory
#   corruption, which nothing here can observe.  It is read in the source.
#
# The sandbox machinery is sandbox-txnfail.py's, imported (keys
# 0x716d0901/0902, check_admin stubbed IN THE COPY ONLY, SD_CONFIG).
