"""test-scramprobe-units.py - free check over gplbld/scram-probe.py.

Adopted 15 Sep 2026 from the Windows port's test of the same name (its
RELEASE_1.1 42), under the owner's rule that Linux follows the Windows port's
decisions; its open/write rows are left out, because this probe has no
--open/--write.

  python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/test-scramprobe-units.py

No sudo, no install, no sd.  scram-probe.py drives the server's TLS+SCRAM login
directly, and its own SCRAM arithmetic has to be right, or a real red would be
blamed on the server.  This checks the parts that need no server:

  1. RFC 7677 section 3 vector: scram_compute() produces exactly the published
     ClientProof and server signature.
  2. libssl loads, and every OpenSSL symbol the Tls class declares resolves
     against it (the ABI is right).
  3. the mode and precondition decisions: no password -> exit 2, commands
     without --account -> exit 2, --no-tls to a dead port is never a pass, two
     modes at once are refused before anything connects.
  4. the wire line's three answers.

Controls: a wrong password must change the proof (the vector is not vacuous), a
mutated c= must change it too, and the wire search must FIND a password that is
there.

Exit 0 all passed, 1 a check failed, 2 could not run (the probe is missing, or
fewer checks ran than expected - the null case, refused).
