#                            own, driven through the cases that have already
#                            caught it out.  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22.

# No sudo, no install, no sd.  Exit 0 all cases passed, 1 a case failed.
#
# ***WHY THIS EXISTS: THE VERIFIER'S FIRST RUN REPORTED TWO DEFECTS SD DOES NOT
# HAVE, AND THE FAULT WAS IN THE PARSER ON THIS SIDE.***  Measured 12 Sep 2026.
# cases_from() ended each line with line.rstrip(), "want" was the last field,
# and the two cases whose expectation ENDS IN SPACES - TRIMF and FMT.L - came
# back as "expected 'ab', got 'ab  '".  TRIMB passed in the same run because
# its spaces are LEADING, which is what pinned the fault to the instrument
# rather than to the product.  Cases 1-8 are that parser, and case 4 is the
# exact shape that failed.
#
# ***AND THE COVERAGE ARITHMETIC IS WORTH MORE TESTING THAN THE PARSER, BECAUSE
# ITS FAILURE MODE IS SILENT.***  A parser fault shows up as a red row somebody
# investigates.  An exercised() that matched too loosely would report a
# function as covered when nothing calls it, and the run would go green - the
# claim "every intrinsic is either exercised or declared" would be false and
# nothing would say so.  Cases 12-19 are that direction: the substring traps
# (INDEX inside INDEXS, SUM inside SUMMATION, NOT inside NOTS) and the one that
# matters most, a function name appearing ONLY as a case label in a string
# literal.

# ***--module IS THE RED CONTROL, AND IT IS HERE FOR THE REASON --probe IS ON
# THE VERIFIERS.***  A units file that has only ever been seen green is
# evidence that it is quiet.  Measured 12 Sep 2026: pointed at a copy of
# verify-basicfuncs.py whose cases_from() takes the pre-fix "len(parts) < 4"
# branch, it goes 3 of 25 red - cases 6, 7 and 8 - and exits 1.
#
# ***CASE 4 STAYS GREEN IN THAT CONTROL, AND THAT IS THE HONEST READING RATHER
# THAN A GAP.***  The trailing spaces are protected by the PROBE emitting the
# terminator, not by this parser refusing lines that lack it: given a line that
# has one, even the pre-fix code reads the fields correctly.  The two halves of
# the fix guard different failures - the terminator stops the loss, the refusal
# stops a lost line being read as a good one - and only the second is this
# file's to test.
