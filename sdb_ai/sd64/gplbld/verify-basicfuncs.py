# verify-basicfuncs.py - do SD BASIC's intrinsic functions and operators return
#                        the RIGHT ANSWERS?  PORT_ADOPTION queue 22, ranked
#                        item 5; intent from the port's verify-basicfuncs.ps1.
#
#   python3 /home/don/Projects/SDCore4Linux/sdb_ai/sd64/gplbld/verify-basicfuncs.py
#   python3 .../verify-basicfuncs.py --allow-stale     measure a stale install
#
# NO SUDO.  Exit 0 every decisive check passed, 1 a decisive check failed,
# 2 the test could not be run.
#
# ***WHY IT EXISTS: IT ASKS THE QUESTION UNDERNEATH THE OTHER VERIFIERS.***
# They ask whether a status was discarded, a lock stranded, a tier enforced.
# This one asks whether the language answers correctly at all - every report,
# every VOC verb, every one of those other verifiers is built out of these
# functions.  Nothing else in this tree checks that ABS, OCONV, LOCATE or the
# comparison operators return correct values, so a pcode or opcode regression
# would surface as a wrong report from a user rather than as a red step.
#
# THREE THINGS IT DOES THAT THE PORT'S SCRIPT DOES NOT, EACH FOR A REASON THAT
# WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED:
#
#   1. ***PYTHON DERIVES THE VERDICT; THE PROBE ONLY REPORTS.***  The port's
#      probe prints OK| or FAIL| from its own "if sg = sw", which makes a BASIC
#      program the judge of a language whose EQUALITY OPERATOR IS ONE OF THE
#      THINGS UNDER TEST.  A broken "=" would print OK for every case and the
#      run would go green.  Here each case prints CASE|name|got|want on ONE
#      path, every case becomes its own decisive row in sdverify's table, and
#      the probe's own tally is reconciled against Python's as a SECOND
#      instrument rather than as the verdict.
#      ***THAT RECONCILIATION ROW (Q1) FIRED ON THE VERY FIRST RUN, AND WHAT
#      IT CAUGHT WAS A DEFECT IN THIS FILE.***  12 Sep 2026: the probe counted
#      0 failures, Python derived 2, and Python was wrong - its own rstrip()
#      had trimmed the trailing spaces off the TRIMF and FMT.L expectations.
#      A verifier that trusted the probe would have gone green; one that
#      trusted only itself would have reported two defects SD does not have.
#      Reporting the DISAGREEMENT is what made the fault findable, and the
#      terminator described in cases_from() is the fix.
#
#   2. ***THE COVERAGE CLAIM IS MEASURED.***  The probe's NOT.TESTED: comment
#      lines are machine-readable.  This script reads the intrinsics table out
#      of the SOURCE tree's sdsys/GPL.BP/BCOMP and FAILS if any intrinsic is
#      neither exercised by the probe nor named as excluded.  Running that
#      arithmetic against the port, 12 Sep 2026, is what found the gap this
#      probe closes: of the same 176 intrinsics, the port's file accounts for
#      175 - DELETE is both tested and declared excluded, CHANGE is excluded
#      under "change the process" when gplsrc/op_chnge.c is a substring
#      replace, and SWAP, ASSIGNED and UNASSIGNED appear on neither list.
#      ***SO THE PORT'S "everything else is exercised below" WAS FIVE NAMES
#      OPTIMISTIC, AND NOTHING THERE COULD HAVE TOLD IT.***
#
#   3. ***THE CASE COUNT IS RECONCILED AGAINST THE PROBE SOURCE, NOT AGAINST A
#      CONSTANT.***  A number in this file would go stale the first time a case
#      was added.  The probe is straight-line code, so the number of "gosub
#      check" sites in the staged source is exactly the number of cases that
#      must print; fewer means it stopped part way, and that is exit 2 rather
#      than "no failures found".
#
# RUN IT UNELEVATED, and that is not a preference.  The probe is compiled and
# run in the CALLER'S OWN account; a root session lands in SDSYS, where the
# probe is not, so it would measure the wrong account or nothing at all.
#
# NOT INSTALLED AND NOT SHIPPED.  verify-basicfuncs.bp lives next to this file
# and is staged into the account's BP only for the run.
