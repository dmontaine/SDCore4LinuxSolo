"""Unit test for gplbld/sd-elevate, SD Core for Linux.

Written 09 Sep 26 for PRE_RELEASE 14.

WHAT IT IS FOR.  sd-elevate is the one command the sdsys user (SD's
administrator) may run as root, so everything that stops that being a root
shell lives in its argument validation.  This drives that validation through
--dry-run, which acts on nothing and needs no privilege, so the escalation
attempts below can be run safely as an ordinary user.

THE TWO HALVES MATTER EQUALLY.  The REFUSE rows are the point of the helper.
The ALLOW rows are the control: a script that refused everything would pass
every REFUSE row and be useless, and that failure mode is invisible without
them.  This is CLAUDE.md's rule that a test which passes because it did nothing
must fail - so the run REFUSES ITS OWN NULL CASE at the bottom if either half
is empty, or if the helper is missing, rather than reporting 0 of 0 as success.
