#
#   fields() - a directory-file record's fields are separated by "\n" and the
#   last one is TERMINATED by one.  Splitting without dropping that terminator
#   invents a trailing empty field, so a 5-field record reads as 6 and
#   `len(rec) >= n` starts answering yes for a field that is not there.  Nothing
#   about that is visible in a transcript: the rows just quietly compare '' to
#   ''.  Cases 1-7.
#
#   group_members() - grp.getgrnam only lists the SUPPLEMENTARY members of a
#   group.  A user whose PRIMARY group is the one being asked about is absent
#   from gr_mem, so a naive membership test calls a real member a non-member -
#   and here that would fail U4/U5 against a perfectly correct system, or, in
#   the direction that matters, pass a row asserting somebody is NOT a member
#   when they are.  Cases 8-11 use the real /etc/group, because a synthetic one
#   cannot reproduce the primary-group half.
