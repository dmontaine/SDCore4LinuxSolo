/* ONE-LINE COMMENTS ONLY IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE. */
/* gen_includes.py turns a line that OPENS a C comment into a BASIC "*"     */
/* comment and passes every other line through UNCHANGED, so the            */
/* continuation lines of a multi-line C block comment are emitted as BARE   */
/* BASIC.  Measured 09 Sep 26: a block comment written here compiled clean  */
/* in C, passed "make check-includes", and then gave 17 errors in BOTH      */
/* LOGIN and CPROC - every program that includes this one.                  */
/* Do not write a comment-opening sequence inside these comments either:    */
/* that is -Wcomment, and this file is built with -Wall.                    */

/* 09 Sep 26 dm - PRE_RELEASE 17.  THE STAMP IS THIS PROJECT'S NUMBER NOW.  */
/* It read "1.0-2", which is UPSTREAM's build, so the shipped binary told   */
/* the user it was a version of something else.                            */
/*                                                                         */
/* THE L IS THE POINT, AND IT IS THE PORT'S SHAPE.  Owner, 24 Aug 26, of    */
/* the Windows port: "our numbering sequence is different than upstream,    */
/* hence the W in front of the number."  So sdb64 at 1.0-2 and upstream dev */
/* at 1.0-3 are not numbers to catch up with - the trailing digit must NOT  */
/* be advanced to track them, because that would imply a parity this port   */

/* MAJOR_REV, MINOR_REV AND BUILD ARE DELIBERATELY LEFT AT UPSTREAM'S       */
/* 1/0/2, exactly as the port leaves them.  sysseg.c:48 packs them into a   */
/* shared-segment compatibility word, so they are a binary interface and    */
/* not a name.  ONLY THE DISPLAY STRING IS OURS.                           */
/*                                                                         */

/* LOGIN:381 is "if compare(system(1012), SD.REV.STAMP)" - system(1012)     */
/* returns the C value (op_sys.c:355-358) and SD.REV.STAMP is the BASIC one */
/* compiled into LOGIN - and on a mismatch it displays sysmsg 5029 and      */
/* TERMINATES THE CONNECTION for any session that is not internal.  That is */
