   IsAdmin() is GONE - 09 Sep 26 dm, PRE_RELEASE 18 commit 2.

   It was "return (getuid() == 0)", and PRE_RELEASE 18 listed it as one of the
   two tests to replace.  Entry 19 had already removed its only call site (the
   "|| IsAdmin()" in K_ADMINISTRATOR), so by 09 Sep 26 it was dead: the whole
   tree held one definition and one declaration and no caller.

   IT IS DELETED RATHER THAN LEFT because it answers the wrong question and
   reads as though it answers the right one.  "Is this process root" is not
   this system's definition of an administrator - that is sdadmin membership
   AND a registered ADMINISTRATOR tier, decided in CPROC's grant.administrator
   and read through kernel(K$ADMINISTRATOR,-1).  The port's IsAdmin() asks
   getgrouplist(), which is a third question again; do not copy it in.        */

           spellings of one file compared unequal, and a "resolve, then check
           it is under the root" test was defeated by one made-up name.

           The component does not exist, so there is no symlink to follow;
           carry on with the next one.  p IS RESET TO q FIRST, and that is the
           part the proposal's "move the advance" means: p was set to q + 1
           above, which for the LAST component is one past the terminator, and
